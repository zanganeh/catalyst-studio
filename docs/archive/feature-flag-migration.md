# Feature Flag Migration Guide

## What's Changed?

As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we've removed the feature flag system from Catalyst Studio. This means all features are now permanently available to all users without needing to enable them manually.

## Impact on Users

### For Most Users: No Action Required
If you were already using Catalyst Studio with all features enabled, you won't notice any changes. Everything continues to work as before.

### What's Different?
- **Feature Flags Page Removed**: The `/feature-flags` page no longer exists
- **All Features Enabled**: Every feature is now available by default
- **No Toggle Switches**: Feature toggle UI elements have been removed
- **Cleaner Interface**: Simplified navigation without conditional items

## Permanently Enabled Features

All of the following features are now available to everyone:

### 1. Enhanced Chat Panel
- Structured prompt templates
- Advanced AI capabilities
- Rich text formatting
- Context-aware suggestions

### 2. Chat Persistence
- Automatic save of chat sessions
- Chat history management
- Quick access to previous conversations
- Session recovery after browser refresh

### 3. Content Builder
- Full WYSIWYG editing capabilities
- Component library access
- Template system
- Real-time preview

### 4. Preview System
- Multi-device preview (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Live content updates
- Device frame visualization
- Zoom controls

### 5. Source Code View
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Code export functionality
- Live code editing
- Format preservation

### 6. Visual Enhancements
- Glass morphism effects
- Modern UI styling
- Smooth animations
- Enhanced visual feedback

## localStorage Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup
When you first load Catalyst Studio after this update, the application will automatically:
1. Remove old feature flag data from your browser's localStorage
2. Set a migration flag to prevent repeated cleanup
3. Preserve all your other data (projects, settings, etc.)

### Manual Cleanup (Optional)
If you want to manually clear old feature flag data:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Application/Storage tab
3. Find localStorage for the Catalyst Studio domain
4. Look for and delete the `featureFlags` key (if it exists)

Or run this in the console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('featureFlags');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I can't see some features that were previously available
**A:** All features should be visible. Try:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Check if you're logged in (if authentication is required)

### Q: The application seems slower after the update
**A:** The removal of feature flags should actually improve performance. If you experience issues:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try using an incognito/private window

### Q: I see an error about missing feature flags
**A:** This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Hard refresh your browser
2. Clear localStorage completely (Developer Tools > Application > Clear Storage)
3. Reload the application

### Q: Can I still disable features I don't want to use?
**A:** While you can't disable features through feature flags anymore, you can:
- Customize your workspace layout
- Hide panels you don't use frequently
- Use keyboard shortcuts to focus on specific tools

## Benefits of This Change

### For Users
- **Simpler Experience**: No need to manage feature toggles
- **Consistent UI**: Everyone has the same features available
- **Better Performance**: Faster load times without feature checks
- **No Configuration**: Features work out of the box

### For Development
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Simplified logic without conditionals
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and test
- **Faster Development**: New features can be added more quickly
- **Better Reliability**: Fewer edge cases to handle

## Future Feature Management

Going forward, new features will be:
- Released to everyone simultaneously
- Thoroughly tested before release
- Announced through release notes
- Available immediately upon deployment
