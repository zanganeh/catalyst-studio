# Story 5.6 Critical Fixes Completed

## Date: 2025-08-14

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Jest Configuration Issue ✅
**Problem**: Epic 5 tests could not run because `/tests/` directory was in `testPathIgnorePatterns`
**Fix**: Removed `/tests/` from Jest configuration to allow Epic 5 test suites to execute
**File**: `/jest.config.js`

### 2. AI Context Creation Error ✅
**Problem**: Chat interface failed with "Referenced record not found" error when websiteId='default'
**Fix**: Made AI context optional for chat functionality, skip creation when no valid websiteId exists
**Files Modified**:
- `/lib/api/hooks/use-ai-context.ts` - Added optional enabled parameter
- `/hooks/use-chat-persistence.ts` - Made websiteId optional (string | null)
- `/components/chat/chat-with-persistence.tsx` - Added conditional persistence based on valid websiteId

### 3. Tool Export Structure ✅
**Problem**: Tests expected `allTools` as array but it was exported as object
**Fix**: 
- Exported `allTools` as array for test compatibility
- Created separate `tools` object for named access
- Fixed import paths to use `/index` explicitly
**File**: `/lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts`

## Verification Results

### ✅ Chat API Working
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}]}'
```
- HTTP 200 response
- AI assistant responds correctly
- Tools execute successfully (echoTool tested)

### ✅ Chat Interface Loads
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/chat
```
- HTTP 200 response
- Page loads without errors

### ⚠️ Test Status
- AI tools tests are now runnable but need adaptation to actual tool implementations
- E2E tests need UI element updates to match actual implementation
- Original POC tests were for different tool functionality (creating websites vs managing existing)

## Summary
All critical blocking issues have been resolved:
1. **Tests can now run** - Jest configuration fixed
2. **Chat interface loads** - AI context error resolved
3. **Tools are functional** - Export structure corrected
4. **API is operational** - Verified with curl tests

The system is now functional and ready for final review and testing.
