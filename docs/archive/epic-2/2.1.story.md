# Story 2.1: Audit and Document Feature Flag Usage

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to comprehensively audit all feature flag usage in the codebase,
**so that** we have a complete inventory of what needs to be removed and can plan the removal safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete inventory of all feature flags in use (names, locations, purposes)
2. Documentation of all files containing feature flag references
3. Dependency map showing which components/features depend on which flags
4. List of all test files that mock or test feature flags
5. Identification of any external systems that might reference feature flags
6. Create `docs/feature-flag-audit.md` with findings

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy]

The feature flag system is entirely **client-side** using localStorage. Key characteristics:
- No database involvement (no Prisma schema changes needed)
- localStorage-based persistence with key 'featureFlags'
- Caching layer using Map with 1-second TTL
- Security features: input validation and XSS prevention
- No server-side feature flag checks expected

### Feature Flag System Overview
[Source: config/features.ts]

The system includes 14 feature flags across 4 categories:
1. **Core feature flags** (5): enhancedChat, contentBuilder, contentTypeBuilder, previewSystem, projectPersistence
2. **UI enhancement flags** (4): catalystBranding, glassMorphism, animations, threeColumnLayout
3. **Integration flags** (2): analyticsDisplay, sourceCodeView
4. **Development flags** (3): debugMode, performanceLogging, errorReporting

### File Structure Context
[Source: Project structure analysis]

Key locations to audit:
- `/config/features.ts` - Main feature flag configuration
- `/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and components
- `/components/` - Shared React components
- `/lib/` - Utility functions and services
- `/tests/` - Playwright E2E tests
- `/__tests__/` or `*.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Important Notes from Epic 1
- Story 1.10 removed cmsIntegration flag (noted in comments)
- Some flags show as deprecated (contentBuilder vs contentTypeBuilder)
- Mixed states in current configuration (some true, some false)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: testing-guide.md]

- Tests use Playwright for E2E testing
- Test commands: `npm run test`, `npm run test:ui`
- Protection tests exist in `tests/chat.spec.ts`
- Performance baselines defined (page load <3s, API response <2s)

### Audit Output Requirements
The audit document should be thorough enough that Stories 2.2-2.7 can be executed without needing to re-analyze the codebase. It should serve as the single source of truth for the entire feature flag removal effort.

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Audit completes without disrupting application functionality
- **IV2**: All feature flag usages are documented with no omissions
- **IV3**: No performance impact from audit activities

## Dev Agent Record

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-11

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent audit execution!** This is a textbook example of how to perform a comprehensive codebase audit. The developer correctly understood that Story 2.1 is purely an **audit and documentation story** with no code changes required.

Key strengths:
- Thorough investigation using proper search patterns (grep for imports, direct access, etc.)
- Complete inventory of all 14 feature flags with detailed categorization
- Identified 40+ affected files across the codebase
- Documented the client-side only nature (no database/server involvement)
- Created actionable removal strategy for subsequent stories
- Properly identified and documented an existing type error for future fixing

The audit document at `docs/feature-flag-audit.md` is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides excellent guidance for Stories 2.2-2.7.

### Refactoring Performed

**Not applicable** - This was an audit story with no code changes required or made.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ No code changes made
- Project Structure: ✓ Audit document placed in correct location
- Testing Strategy: ✓ No test changes needed for audit
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

All requirements completed:
- [x] Complete feature flag inventory (14 flags documented)
- [x] File inventory (40+ files categorized)
- [x] Dependency mapping completed
- [x] Test file analysis (7 E2E, 2 unit tests)
- [x] External system check (confirmed none)
- [x] Comprehensive audit document created

### Security Review

The audit correctly identified security aspects of the current implementation:
- XSS prevention via localStorage validation
- Input sanitization in place
- 10000 character limit on localStorage data
- Development-only restrictions on enableFeature/disableFeature

No security concerns with the audit itself.

### Performance Considerations

The audit documented performance characteristics:
- Map-based cache with 1-second TTL
- localStorage read optimization
- Expected performance improvement after removal

### Technical Debt Identified

The audit properly documented existing issues for future resolution:
1. Type error in `contexts/feature-flag-context.tsx` line 50 (references removed 'cmsIntegration')
2. Hardcoded feature list in context out of sync with config
3. Mixed deprecated flags (contentBuilder vs contentTypeBuilder)

These will be addressed in Story 2.2 when removing infrastructure.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

Outstanding work on this audit! The comprehensive documentation provides an excellent foundation for the feature flag removal effort. The audit document is thorough, actionable, and will serve as the single source of truth for Stories 2.2-2.7.
