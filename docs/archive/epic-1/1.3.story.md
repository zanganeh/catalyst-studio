# Story 1.3: Implement Content Type Builder

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** content creator,
**I want** to visually build and manage content types with fields,
**so that** I can define my website's data structure without coding.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Visual content type builder with field management interface
2. Drag-and-drop functionality for field reordering
3. Modal system for field type selection (text, image, date, etc.)
4. Field properties configuration (required, default values, validation)
5. Visual representation of content model relationships

## Integration Verification
- IV1: UI components match mockup's content type builder exactly (reference: `/index.html`)
- IV2: Smooth animations and interactions as demonstrated
- IV3: Modal system properly manages z-index and overlay behavior

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- Enhanced chat panel successfully implemented with feature flags
- React Context pattern established for state management
- Modal/overlay patterns can follow typing-indicator z-index approach
- Dynamic imports used for code splitting - apply same pattern here

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md]

#### Data Models
The ContentType and Field models are defined in the architecture document:

**ContentType Model** [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
- `id`: string - Unique identifier
- `name`: string - Content type name (e.g., "BlogPost")
- `pluralName`: string - Plural form for collections
- `icon`: string - Emoji icon for visual identification
- `fields`: Field[] - Array of field definitions
- `relationships`: Relationship[] - Links to other content types

**Field Model** [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
- `id`: string - Unique field identifier
- `name`: string - Field name (camelCase)
- `label`: string - Display label
- `type`: FieldType - One of: text, number, boolean, date, image, richText, reference
- `required`: boolean - Is field required
- `defaultValue`: any - Default value if not provided
- `validation`: ValidationRules - Zod schema for validation
- `helpText`: string - Helper text for users
- `placeholder`: string - Input placeholder

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture]

The content type builder should follow the established error boundary pattern:
```typescript
<MainContentErrorBoundary>
  <ContentTypeBuilder />
</MainContentErrorBoundary>
```

#### State Management
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- Use React Context for content type state (established pattern from Story 1.2)
- Consider Zustand for complex UI state if Context becomes unwieldy
- Zod (v3.25.76) already available for validation schemas

#### UI Components
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- Use shadcn/ui components (Dialog for modal, Button, Input, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS (3.4.17) for styling
- Framer Motion (11.x) for animations if needed

#### Drag and Drop Library Selection
The architecture doesn't specify a DnD library. Recommended: @dnd-kit/sortable
- Modern, accessible, touch-friendly
- Better performance than react-beautiful-dnd
- Works well with React 19

#### File Structure
Based on established patterns:
```
components/
├── content-builder/
│   ├── content-type-builder.tsx
│   ├── sortable-field-list.tsx
│   ├── field-type-modal.tsx
│   ├── field-properties-panel.tsx
│   └── relationship-diagram.tsx
lib/
├── content-types/
│   └── types.ts
├── context/
│   └── content-type-context.tsx
└── storage/
    └── content-type-storage.ts
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

- Test files location: Create `__tests__` folders within component directories
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Performance requirement: UI updates must complete within 2 seconds
- Test with feature flag both enabled and disabled
- Drag-and-drop requires special testing utilities from @testing-library/user-event

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing ProjectContext from Story 1.2
- Navigation sidebar from Story 1.1 needs new menu item
- Feature flag system already established - use same pattern
- Error boundary hierarchy must be maintained

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Requirements]
- Field operations must be optimized for 50+ fields
- Target render time: <100ms for field operations
- Target: Smooth 60fps during drag-and-drop operations
- Drag-and-drop should use React.memo for field items
- Modal animations should use CSS transforms, not JavaScript
- Auto-save should debounce to prevent excessive writes
