# Story 1.6: Add Content Management and Editing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** content editor,
**I want** to create and edit content items,
**so that** I can populate my website with real data.

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Story 1.3 (Content Type Builder) must be completed first to create content types
- **Note**: This story assumes content types exist from Story 1.3 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Content list view with all items for selected content type
2. Modal-based content creation and editing forms
3. Form fields dynamically generated based on content type
4. Save and cancel functionality with proper state management
5. Content preview in list view

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Modal system matches mockup's design and behavior
- IV2: Form generation works with all field types
- IV3: Content changes reflect immediately in preview

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.5b**: The unified design system has been successfully implemented with centralized design tokens in `/lib/design-system/`. All new components should use these tokens for consistency. The dark theme with glass morphism effects is now standard across all pages.

### Architecture Context

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- All new components should follow the established pattern with error boundaries
- Use feature flags for new functionality: `contentBuilder: boolean` flag controls this feature
- Components should be placed in `components/content/` directory

#### State Management
[Source: architecture.md#State Management Architecture]
- Use Zustand for complex UI state management (content CRUD operations)
- React Context remains for simpler state (current content type selection)
- Local component state with useState for form inputs

#### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models and Schema Changes]

**ContentType Model Structure:**
```typescript
interface ContentType {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  pluralName: string;
  icon: string;
  fields: Field[];
  relationships: Relationship[];
}
```

**Field Model Structure:**
```typescript
interface Field {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'text' | 'richText' | 'image' | 'date' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'reference';
  required: boolean;
  defaultValue: any;
  validation: ValidationRule[];
  order: number;
}
```

**ContentItem Model:**
```typescript
interface ContentItem {
  id: string;
  contentTypeId: string;
  data: Record<string, any>; // Dynamic based on content type fields
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### File Structure

```

#### UI Components to Use
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- **shadcn/ui components**: Dialog, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Button, Toast
- **React Hook Form**: For form state management with Zod validation
- **Framer Motion**: For modal animations and transitions

#### Persistence Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Persistence Layer Architecture]
- Use the established StorageService with IndexedDB as primary, localStorage as fallback
- Content items should be stored under key: `project:${projectId}:content`
- Implement optimistic updates with rollback on failure

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

#### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Place in `components/content/*.test.tsx` files
- **Integration Tests**: Place in `tests/features/content.spec.ts`
- **E2E Tests**: Place in `tests/integration/content-journey.spec.ts`

#### Testing Standards
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- Mock Zustand stores for unit tests
- Test coverage target: 80% for new code
- All tests must pass before PR merge

#### Specific Test Requirements
- Test all field types in form generator
- Test validation for required fields
- Test modal keyboard navigation
- Test content persistence across page reloads
- Test error states and recovery

### Performance Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Budget]
- Modal open/close animations must maintain 60fps
- Form generation should complete within 100ms
- Content list should virtualize if >50 items
- Save operations should show optimistic updates immediately

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Security Integration]
- All user-generated content must be sanitized using DOMPurify
- Validate all inputs on both client and server (future)
- Prevent XSS in rich text fields
- Implement proper escape handling for special characters
