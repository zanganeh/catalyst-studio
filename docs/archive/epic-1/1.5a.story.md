# Story 1.5a: Fix Navigation System and Layout Persistence

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the navigation system to work correctly with persistent layout,
**so that** I can navigate between features while maintaining context and the three-column layout.

## Context
This is a corrective story created after Story 1.5 implementation revealed navigation issues that deviate from PRD requirements. The current implementation breaks the three-column layout when navigating and has redundant/confusing menu items.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Three-column layout (chat + nav + content) persists across all navigation
2. Overview is a direct link to dashboard (not expandable)
3. Content section properly separates "Content Items" from "Content Modeling"
4. Analytics is a direct link (not expandable with single child)
5. Preview is accessible at appropriate navigation level
6. No duplicate "Chat" in navigation (already visible in left panel)
7. All views load in the right panel, not as separate pages

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Navigation maintains the three-column layout from PRD FR1
- IV2: All existing features remain accessible
- IV3: No performance degradation during navigation
- IV4: Chat panel remains functional during navigation

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Restructure Navigation Hierarchy (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- [x] Remove "Chat" from Overview submenu
- [x] Convert Overview to direct link (not expandable)
- [x] Rename and reorganize Content section:
  - [x] "Content Items" → /content (view/manage instances)
  - [x] "Content Modeling" → /content-builder (build schemas)
- [x] Convert Analytics to direct link (remove redundant submenu)
- [x] Update NavigationSection type to support both direct links and expandable sections

### Task 2: Fix Layout Persistence (AC: 1, 7)
- [x] Create unified layout wrapper that maintains three-column structure
- [x] Remove separate (dashboard) layout that breaks the structure
- [x] Ensure all routes use the persistent layout with chat + nav + content panels
- [x] Update routing to load content in MainContentPanel, not as separate pages
- [x] Add proper state management to maintain panel visibility

### Task 3: Implement Smart Routing System (AC: 7)
- [x] Create router component that loads views in MainContentPanel
- [x] Update all navigation links to use internal routing (not page navigation)
- [x] Implement view switching without page reload
- [x] Add loading states for smooth transitions
- [x] Preserve chat state during navigation

### Task 4: Fix Content Organization (AC: 3)
- [x] Clarify distinction between Content Items and Content Modeling
- [x] Update labels and icons for better clarity
- [x] Ensure Content Items shows list of content instances
- [x] Ensure Content Modeling shows the schema builder
- [x] Add helpful descriptions/tooltips

### Task 5: Preview Accessibility (AC: 5)
- [x] Evaluate Preview placement (under Content vs top-level)
- [x] Ensure Preview is easily discoverable
- [x] Add Preview icon to make it more prominent
- [x] Consider adding quick-access Preview button in main content area

### Task 6: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test navigation flow maintains layout
- [x] Verify chat remains functional during navigation
- [x] Test all menu items load correctly in right panel
- [x] Verify no duplicate navigation items
- [x] Test mobile responsive behavior
- [x] Validate against PRD requirements FR1, FR6
- [x] Performance test: Navigation switches < 100ms
- [x] Test feature flag toggle for gradual rollout

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 completion:
- Navigation sections are expandable with smooth animations
- View switching uses Next.js routing
- Mobile navigation drawer implemented
- State persistence using localStorage established

### PRD Requirements Reference
[Source: docs/prd.md]

**FR1** (Line 88-89): "The application shall implement the three-column layout from the approved mockup with chat panel (360px), navigation sidebar (260px), and flexible main content area"

**FR6** (Line 95): "The navigation system shall implement expandable sections for content management, analytics, development, and integrations"

### Architecture Context

#### Current Issues to Fix
1. **Layout Breaking**: Dashboard routes use separate layout (`app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) instead of maintaining three-column structure
2. **Redundant Navigation**: "Chat" appears in navigation despite being in left panel
3. **Confusing Hierarchy**: Overview → Dashboard is unnecessary nesting
4. **Poor Organization**: Content Types and Content Builder appear to be same thing
5. **Route Handling**: Views open as new pages instead of loading in MainContentPanel

#### Proposed Navigation Structure
```typescript
const navigationItems = [
  {
    type: 'link',
    label: 'Overview',
    href: '/dashboard',
    icon: Home,
  },
  {
    type: 'section',
    label: 'Content',
    items: [
      { label: 'Content Items', href: '/content' },
      { label: 'Content Modeling', href: '/content-builder' },
    ]
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    label: 'Preview',
    href: '/preview',
    icon: Eye,
  },
  {
    type: 'section',
    label: 'Development',
    items: [
      { label: 'Source Code', href: '/development' },
      { label: 'Components', href: '/components' },
    ]
  },
  {
    type: 'section',
    label: 'Integrations',
    items: [
      { label: 'CMS Connections', href: '/integrations' },
    ]
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    label: 'Analytics',
    href: '/analytics',
    icon: BarChart3,
  }
]
```

#### Layout Persistence Strategy
[Source: Project Brief Line 13-16]
- Maintain three-column layout across all views
- Chat panel (360px) - always visible on left
- Navigation sidebar (260px) - middle column
- Main content (flex) - right panel for all views
- Use React Context for view management instead of page routing

#### File Structure Changes
```
app/
├── layout.tsx (main layout with three columns)
├── page.tsx (redirects to /chat)
├── chat/
│   └── page.tsx (default view with chat in focus)
└── [[...slug]]/  # Catch-all for internal routing
    └── page.tsx  # Renders appropriate component in MainContentPanel
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/prd.md - Testing Infrastructure]
- Use Playwright for E2E testing of navigation flows
- Test layout persistence across all navigation
- Verify chat functionality during view switches
- Test mobile navigation behavior
- Ensure feature flags work correctly

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Chat functionality disruption during navigation changes
  - **Mitigation**: Implement behind `navigationFix` feature flag
  - **Rollback**: Can disable flag to revert to current behavior
- **Risk**: Performance degradation from persistent layout
  - **Mitigation**: Lazy loading, React.memo optimization
  - **Target**: < 100ms navigation switches

### Feature Flag Implementation
```typescript
// Feature flag for gradual rollout
const useNewNavigation = isFeatureEnabled('navigationFix');

// Allow toggle between old and new navigation
if (useNewNavigation) {
  // New unified layout with persistent three-column
} else {
  // Current implementation (fallback)
}
```
