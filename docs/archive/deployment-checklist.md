# Deployment Checklist - Epic 2 Feature Flag Removal

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Code Quality Checks
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Linting passes without errors (warnings present in test files)
- [ ] All tests pass (some pre-existing test failures)
- [ ] Build completes successfully (fails due to linting)

### Feature Verification
- [x] All Epic 1 features working in development
  - [x] Enhanced chat panel
  - [x] Chat persistence
  - [x] Content builder
  - [x] Preview system
  - [x] Source code view
  - [x] Glass morphism effects
  - [x] All navigation items visible

### Code Review
- [x] No remaining feature flag references in source code
- [x] All stub files removed
- [x] localStorage cleanup utility in place
- [x] Documentation updated

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Staging Deployment
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build
npm test

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging
```

### 2. Staging Verification
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify all features accessible
- [ ] Test localStorage cleanup works
- [ ] Monitor for performance issues

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Epic 2: Feature flag removal complete"
git push origin v2.0.0

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify user access to features
- [ ] Monitor support channels

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   
   # Redeploy previous version
   npm run deploy:production --tag=v1.x.x
   ```

2. **Hotfix Approach**
   - Create hotfix branch
   - Fix critical issues
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy hotfix

### Rollback Considerations
- No database migrations to reverse
- Feature flags were client-side only
- localStorage cleanup is non-destructive
- All features were already live in Epic 1

## Monitoring Points

### Application Health
- Server response times
- Client-side performance metrics
- Error rates
- Memory usage

### User Experience
- Page load times
- Feature accessibility
- Browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

### Business Metrics
- User engagement
- Feature adoption
- Support ticket volume
- User feedback

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
1. Notify development team of deployment
2. Alert support team of changes
3. Update internal documentation
4. Schedule retrospective meeting

### External Communication
1. Update release notes
2. Send user notification (if needed)
3. Update public documentation
4. Monitor community feedback

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ✅ All feature flag code removed
- ✅ Application builds and deploys
- ✅ No increase in error rates
- ✅ Performance improved or maintained

### Business Success
- ✅ All users have access to all features
- ✅ No disruption to service
- ✅ Positive or neutral user feedback
- ✅ Simplified maintenance going forward

## Notes

### Known Issues
- Linting warnings in test files (non-critical)
- Some pre-existing test failures (not related to Epic 2)
- Build fails due to strict linting rules

### Recommendations
1. Fix linting errors before production deployment
2. Update test suite to fix failing tests
3. Consider relaxing linting rules for test files
4. Monitor closely during first 24 hours post-deployment
