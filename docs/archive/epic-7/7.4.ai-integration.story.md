# Story 7.4: Create AI System Prompt Integration

## Status
Ready for QA

## Estimation
3-4 days (development time)

## Story
**As an** AI system,  
**I want** structured templates with dynamic knowledge of existing types and components,  
**so that** I can intelligently generate new content types that leverage existing components, follow best practices, and avoid duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic primitive type loader that reads all available primitive types using reflection/introspection
2. Database content type loader that fetches existing content types and properties **for the current website/project only**
3. Dynamic property loader that identifies reusable properties (e.g., ContentArea, components) **within current project scope**
4. Static prompt templates with injection points for dynamic content
5. Generation rules documentation that combines static guidelines with dynamic awareness
6. Validation system that prevents recreation of existing types and ensures proper reuse
7. Type examples catalog that includes both static examples AND dynamically loaded types
8. System prompt enhancement that injects current system state into AI context
9. Integration with existing prompt system (lib/prompts/) for universal type generation
10. CLAUDE.md updated with hybrid generation patterns and commands
11. Platform capability matrix based on real platform analysis
12. Confidence scoring system for generated types
13. Session-aware context that updates with newly generated types in real-time

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Primitive type loader successfully reads all types from lib/providers/universal/types/primitives/
- [ ] Database loader fetches existing content types and properties **for current website context only**
- [ ] Static prompt templates created with dynamic injection points
- [ ] Generation rules document combines static patterns with dynamic type references
- [ ] AI can reference and reuse existing types/components in generation
- [ ] Validation prevents duplicate type creation
- [ ] Type examples include both curated examples and live system types
- [ ] System prompts successfully merge static templates with dynamic context
- [ ] Integration with lib/prompts/ completed for universal type templates
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with hybrid generation commands
- [ ] Platform capability matrix populated from actual system analysis
- [ ] Integration tests prove AI uses both static guidance and dynamic context properly
- [ ] All tests passing (unit and integration)
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by team
- [ ] PR approved by tech lead

## Success Metrics
- AI successfully reuses existing components when applicable
- Zero duplicate type creation when similar types exist
- AI references existing primitive types correctly
- Generated types follow static templates while adapting to current system state
- 70%+ confidence score for generated types
- 10+ static example types provide patterns for common use cases
- AI recognizes and avoids recreating types it just generated in the same session

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Too much context overwhelms AI
  - **Mitigation**: Load only current project's types, not all system types
- **Risk**: Static templates become outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Regular review process, version control for templates
- **Risk**: Conflict between static rules and dynamic state
  - **Mitigation**: Clear precedence rules, validation layer to catch conflicts

    ```markdown
    # Universal Type Generation Rules
    
    ## Rule 1: Check for Existing Types First
    Before creating any new type, check if {{existingContentTypes}} already contains it.
    Example: If BlogPost exists, don't create ArticlePage - suggest using BlogPost
    
    ## Rule 2: Use Only Available Primitive Types
    All fields MUST use types from {{availableTypes}}:
    - For short text (titles, names) → Use 'Text'
    - For long content → Use 'LongText'
    - For media → Use 'Media'
    
    ## Rule 3: Reuse Components
    If {{reusableComponents}} includes ContentArea, use it for complex content
    
    ## Validation Requirements:
    - Type name must be unique (not in {{existingContentTypes}})
    - All field types must exist in {{availableTypes}}
    - Follow naming: PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields
    ```

- [x] Create Static Prompt Templates with Dynamic Injection
  - [x] Create `prompts/universal-types/templates/content-type-generation.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Generate Universal Content Type
    
    ## Current Project Context:
    Project: {{projectContext}}
    
    ## Available Building Blocks:
    Primitive Types: {{availableTypes}}
    Existing Types in Project: {{existingContentTypes}}
    Reusable Components: {{reusableComponents}}
    
    ## Your Task:
    Create a content type that:
    1. Doesn't duplicate existing types above
    2. Uses only primitive types listed above
    3. Reuses components where applicable
    
    ## Output Format:
    {
      "name": "TypeName",
      "category": "page|component",
      "fields": [
        {"name": "fieldName", "type": "Text", "required": true}
      ]
    }
    ```
  
  - [x] Create `prompts/universal-types/templates/duplication-check.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Check for Duplicate Types
    
    ## Requested Type: [User's Request]
    
    ## Existing Types in Project:
    {{existingContentTypes}}
    
    ## Analysis:
    1. Does exact type name exist? → Check {{existingContentTypes}}
    2. Is there 80%+ field overlap with existing type?
    3. Can existing type be extended instead?
    
    ## Response:
    IF duplicate found: "Use existing [TypeName] instead"
    IF no duplicate: "Safe to create new type"

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context
**Parent Epic**: Epic 7 - Universal Type System Implementation
- This story is part of the larger Universal Type System initiative
- Builds upon Story 7.3 (Three-Layer Type System) which established the primitive types foundation
- Goal: Enable AI to intelligently generate content types using both static templates and dynamic system awareness
- Part of the brownfield project approach to incrementally improve the existing Catalyst Studio system

### GitFlow Workflow
**Branch Name**: feature/epic7-ai-integration  
**Base Branch**: main  
**PR Target**: main  

**Git Commands**:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/epic7-ai-integration`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, test:)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/epic7-ai-integration`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 7 Story 7.4: Hybrid AI System Prompt Integration"

**Commit Message Guidelines**:
- feat: New feature implementation
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation changes
- test: Test additions or changes
- chore: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- refactor: Code refactoring without feature changes

### Testing Standards
**Test Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: Alongside implementation files as `*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` directory
- E2E tests: `__tests__/e2e/` directory
- Test fixtures: `__tests__/fixtures/` directory

**Testing Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for loaders and validators
- All dynamic loaders must have unit tests
- Template population logic must be tested with various contexts
- Validation system requires comprehensive test coverage
- Mock database calls for unit tests
- Use real type system files for integration tests

**Test Execution Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Testing Patterns**:
- Use describe/it blocks for test organization
- Mock external dependencies (database, file system)
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure async operations are properly tested

### Hybrid Architecture Key Points
- **Static Templates**: Provide structure, rules, and guidance for AI
- **Dynamic Loaders**: Provide current state awareness and prevent duplication
- **Integration Layer**: Merges both approaches seamlessly
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages lib/prompts/ and lib/providers/universal/
- **Project Isolation**: Each website/project has its own isolated context - no cross-contamination
- **Session Awareness**: Newly generated types are immediately available in the same session

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Extends current prompt system rather than replacing it
- Uses universal type system as source of truth
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows

### Directory Structure Clarification
- **Code Files** (`lib/prompts/`): All TypeScript implementation files
  - `lib/prompts/loaders/` - Dynamic loading implementations
  - `lib/prompts/context/` - Context builders and managers
- **Configuration Files** (`prompts/universal-types/`): Templates and rules
  - `prompts/universal-types/templates/` - Static prompt templates
  - `prompts/universal-types/rules/` - Generation rules documentation
  - `prompts/universal-types/examples/` - Example type definitions
  - `prompts/universal-types/platform/` - Platform capability matrices
- **Rationale**: Separation of code (lib/) from configuration (prompts/) for clarity

### Implementation Notes
- Dynamic loading happens on each request (no caching in MVP)
- Load all types for current project (no lazy loading needed yet)
- Simple context building without optimization

### How Templates Work - Concrete Example

**Step 1: User Request**
```
"I need a content type for news articles"
```

**Step 2: System Loads Dynamic Data** (Phase 2 loaders)
```typescript
const dynamicContext = {
  availableTypes: ["Text", "LongText", "Number", "Boolean", "Date", "Media"],
  existingContentTypes: [
    "BlogPost (title: Text, content: LongText, author: Text, publishDate: Date)",
    "ProductPage (name: Text, description: LongText, price: Number)"
  ],
  reusableComponents: ["ContentArea", "CTAComponent"],
  projectContext: "Website: TechNews, ID: proj_123"
};
```

**Step 3: Template Gets Populated** (Phase 3 templates)
The template `content-type-generation.md` becomes:
```markdown
## Available Building Blocks:
Primitive Types: Text, LongText, Number, Boolean, Date, Media
Existing Types in Project: BlogPost, ProductPage
Reusable Components: ContentArea, CTAComponent
```

**Step 4: AI Sees Full Context and Responds**
```json
{
  "decision": "USE_EXISTING",
  "reason": "BlogPost type already exists with all needed fields for news articles",
  "suggestion": "Use existing BlogPost type instead of creating duplicate"
}
```

This prevents duplication and ensures reuse!

### Previous Story Context (Story 7.3)
**Three-Layer Type System Implemented**:
- Primitive types defined in lib/providers/universal/types/primitives/
- Common patterns implemented
- Platform extensions structure created
- This story builds on that by making AI aware of these types

### Database Schema Context
**Content Types Storage** (from existing Optimizely implementation):
- **Primary Tables/Collections**:
  - `websites` - Website configurations and metadata
  - `content_types` - Content type definitions per website
  - `content_items` - Actual content instances
  - `content_versions` - Version history tracking
- **Key Fields for Type Loading**:
  - `content_types.website_id` - For project isolation
  - `content_types.definition` - JSON schema of type structure
  - `content_types.properties` - Field definitions and validation rules
  - `content_types.category` - 'page' or 'component' classification
- **Query Pattern**: Filter by `website_id` from current session context

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each loader
- Integration tests for hybrid system
- End-to-end AI generation tests
- Focus on correctness, not performance

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `__tests__/prompts/` directory for all prompt-related tests
- **Test Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Test Patterns**:
  - Unit tests: `*.test.ts` files alongside implementation
  - Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` directory
  - E2E tests: `__tests__/e2e/` directory
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for loaders and validators
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock database calls, use real type system files
- **Test Data**: Use fixtures from `__tests__/fixtures/` for consistent testing

## Dependencies
- Story 7.3: Three-Layer Type System (Must be complete)
- Database schema must be stable
- Existing prompt system (lib/prompts/) must be functional
- Universal type system (lib/providers/universal/) must be complete

    throw new Error(`Template not found: ${templatePath}`);
  }
  return fs.promises.readFile(fullPath, 'utf-8');
}
```
**FIX REQUIRED:**
```typescript
async loadTemplate(templatePath: string): Promise<string> {
  // Sanitize and validate path
  const sanitized = path.normalize(templatePath);
  const basePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'prompts/universal-types/templates');
  const fullPath = path.join(basePath, sanitized);
  
  // Ensure path is within allowed directory
  if (!fullPath.startsWith(basePath)) {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid template path: attempted directory traversal');
  }
  
  if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {
    throw new Error(`Template not found: ${templatePath}`);
  }
  return fs.promises.readFile(fullPath, 'utf-8');
}
```

2. **TypeScript Safety Bypass**
```typescript
// database-type-loader.ts:75
private transformContentType(ct: any): LoadedContentType  // Using 'any' bypasses all type safety
```
**FIX REQUIRED:** Define proper types for all database entities

3. **No Input Sanitization**
- User-provided type names are not sanitized
- Could lead to injection attacks or malformed data

##### High Priority Security Issues
- Dynamic imports without path validation in primitive-type-loader.ts
- fs.existsSync used without proper error handling
- No rate limiting for type generation operations

#### Performance Analysis (6/10) ⚡

**Issues Found:**
1. **Sequential Loading** (primitive-type-loader.ts:39-41)
```typescript
for (const typeDir of typeDirs) {
  await this.loadTypeFromDirectory(typeDir);  // Sequential, blocking
}
```
**Fix:** Use `Promise.all()` for parallel loading

2. **Memory Leaks Risk**
- Maps without size limits in all loader classes
- No cleanup mechanism for session data
- Could cause memory exhaustion with many types

**Good Practices:**
- Promise.all used correctly in buildContext()
- Efficient type caching strategy (though no expiration)

#### Error Handling (4/10) ❌

**Critical Issues:**
1. Silent failures with console.error
2. No error recovery strategies
3. No custom error types for categorization
4. Missing edge case validation

**Example Problem:**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error loading primitive types:', error);
  return [];  // Silent failure, returns empty array
}
```

#### Code Quality (7.5/10) 📝

**Strengths:**
- Well-documented with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase/camelCase)
- Clear module boundaries
- Good TypeScript usage (except for `any` issues)

**Issues:**
- Code duplication in formatting methods
- Some complex methods could be decomposed
- Magic numbers without constants

#### Testing Coverage (7/10) 🧪

**Good:**
- Proper test structure with mocking
- Integration tests for end-to-end flow
- Good coverage of happy paths

**Missing:**
- Edge case testing
- Security testing
- Performance/load testing
- Concurrent operation testing
- Error recovery testing

### Critical Fixes Required (Before Production)

#### Priority 1: Security (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)
```typescript
// 1. Fix path traversal in universal-type-context.ts:123
// 2. Replace all 'any' types with proper interfaces
// 3. Add input sanitization for all user inputs
// 4. Validate all dynamic import paths
```

#### Priority 2: Type Safety
```typescript
// Define proper types instead of 'any'
interface DatabaseContentType {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  websiteId: string;
  fields: ContentTypeFields;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Priority 3: Error Handling
```typescript
// Implement proper error handling
class TypeLoadingError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public cause?: Error) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'TypeLoadingError';
  }
}

// Use proper logging
import { logger } from '@/lib/utils/logger';
logger.error('Failed to load types', { error, context });
```

### Performance Optimizations

```typescript
// Replace sequential loading with parallel
const loadPromises = typeDirs.map(dir => this.loadTypeFromDirectory(dir));
const results = await Promise.all(loadPromises);

// Add LRU cache with limits
import LRU from 'lru-cache';
private cache = new LRU<string, any>({
  max: 500,
  ttl: 1000 * 60 * 60 // 1 hour
});
```
