# Story 4.1: Storage Audit and Migration Planning

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to audit all browser storage usage and create a migration plan,  
**so that** I have a complete map of what needs to be migrated.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete grep/search of codebase for localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB usage
2. Document each storage pattern with location, data structure, and purpose
3. Group storage usage into logical modules (content-types, content-items, etc.)
4. Create migration checklist with all identified storage points
5. Estimate complexity for each module migration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Git Setup (REQUIRED FIRST TASK)
  - [x] Checkout and update develop: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
  - [x] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/4-1-storage-audit`
- [x] Comprehensive Storage Audit (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Search for all localStorage usage: `grep -r "localStorage" app/ components/ lib/ hooks/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"`
  - [x] Search for all sessionStorage usage: `grep -r "sessionStorage" app/ components/ lib/ hooks/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"`
  - [x] Search for all IndexedDB usage: `grep -r "indexedDB\|IndexedDB" app/ components/ lib/ hooks/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"`
  - [x] Search for Zustand persist middleware usage: `grep -r "persist\|createJSONStorage" lib/stores/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`
  - [x] Document findings in a structured markdown file: `docs/storage-audit-report.md`
- [x] Analyze Storage Patterns (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] For each storage location found, document:
    - File path and line number
    - Key names being used
    - Data structure/type being stored (inspect actual storage if needed)
    - Purpose/functionality using this storage
    - Component or module it belongs to
  - [x] Group findings by functional module (e.g., content management, chat, settings, etc.)
- [x] Create Migration Checklist (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `docs/storage-migration-checklist.md` with:
    - Complete list of all storage points to migrate
    - Grouping by module with dependencies noted
    - Priority order for migration
    - Complexity estimate (Simple/Medium/Complex) for each module
    - Estimated effort in story points
- [x] Document Migration Plan (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `docs/storage-migration-plan.md` with:
    - Technical approach for migration
    - Module dependency graph
    - Risk assessment for each module
    - Recommended migration sequence
    - Database schema requirements based on current data structures
- [x] Submit PR (REQUIRED FINAL TASK)
  - [x] Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/4-1-storage-audit`
  - [x] Create PR from feature branch â†’ develop branch
  - [x] PR Title: "Epic 4 Story 1: Storage Audit and Migration Planning"
  - [x] Link PR to story in description

## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/4-1-storage-audit
Base Branch: develop (NOT main)  
PR Target: develop (NOT main)

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/4-1-storage-audit`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/4-1-storage-audit`
5. PR: Create PR to develop branch with title "Epic 4 Story 1: Storage Audit and Migration Planning"

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#source-tree-integration]

Current project uses Next.js App Router structure:
- `app/` - Contains pages and API routes
- `components/` - React components
- `lib/` - Utilities including storage services and Zustand stores
- `lib/storage/` - Existing storage services to be audited
- `lib/stores/` - Zustand stores that may use persistence

### Key Areas to Audit
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#identified-constraints]

Based on architecture analysis, focus audit on:
1. **Zustand Persistence**: Currently tied to localStorage - check all stores in `lib/stores/`
2. **Multiple Storage Strategies**: Document use of localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB
3. **Browser Storage Limitations**: Note any data that might exceed typical 5-10MB limits

### Expected Storage Patterns
[Source: epic4-prd.md#existing-project-overview]

The application likely stores:
- Website/project metadata
- Content type definitions
- Content items
- User settings and preferences
- Chat sessions and messages
- Studio tool configurations

### Documentation Requirements
[Source: epic4-prd.md#story-4.1]

The audit documentation should include:
- Location of each storage usage (file:line)
- Data structure being stored
- Purpose and functionality
- Module grouping for logical migration units
- Complexity assessment for migration effort

### No Architecture Changes Required
This is a documentation-only story. No code changes should be made, only analysis and documentation of existing storage patterns.

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/testing-guide.md]

For this audit story:
- No automated tests required (documentation only)
- Manual verification: Ensure all grep searches are comprehensive
- Validation: Cross-reference findings with running application to verify storage keys
- Review checklist: Have another developer verify audit completeness
