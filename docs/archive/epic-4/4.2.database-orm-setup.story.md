## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/4-2-database-orm-setup
Base Branch: develop (NOT main)  
PR Target: develop (NOT main)

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/4-2-database-orm-setup`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/4-2-database-orm-setup`
5. PR: Create PR to develop branch with title "Epic 4 Story 2: Database and ORM Setup"

### Technical Implementation Details

#### ORM Choice: Prisma
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#new-technology-additions]

Use Prisma as the ORM for the following reasons:
- Type-safe queries with auto-generated TypeScript types
- Automatic migration management
- Reduces boilerplate code significantly
- Excellent developer experience with Prisma Studio

#### Database Configuration
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#appendix-quick-reference]

Environment variables setup:
```env
# .env.local (development)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# .env.production (future)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

#### Initial Schema Structure
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]

Create these models in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model Website {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  description String?
  category    String
  metadata    Json?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  contentTypes ContentType[]
  contentItems ContentItem[]
}

model ContentType {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  websiteId String
  name      String
  fields    Json
  settings  Json?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  website      Website       @relation(fields: [websiteId], references: [id])
  contentItems ContentItem[]
}

model ContentItem {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  contentTypeId String
  websiteId    String
  data         Json
  status       String   @default("draft")
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  
  contentType ContentType @relation(fields: [contentTypeId], references: [id])
  website     Website     @relation(fields: [websiteId], references: [id])
}
```

#### Database Client Singleton Pattern
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#database-client-component]

Create `/lib/db/client.ts` with singleton pattern to manage connections:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

// Singleton pattern for Prisma client
declare global {
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
}

export function getClient(): PrismaClient {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient()
  }
  return global.prisma
}

export async function disconnect(): Promise<void> {
  if (global.prisma) {
    await global.prisma.$disconnect()
  }
}
```

#### Project Structure Integration
[Source: architecture/epic4-architecture.md#source-tree-integration]

New files to create:
- `/lib/db/client.ts` - Database client singleton
- `/lib/db/test-connection.ts` - Connection test script
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `/prisma/seed.ts` - Seed data script

These integrate with existing structure without disrupting current functionality.

### Integration Verification Requirements
[Source: epic4-prd.md#story-4.2]

Must verify:
- IV1: Existing app continues to run with `npm run dev`
- IV2: Database setup doesn't interfere with current build process
- IV3: No performance impact on application startup

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/testing-guide.md]

For this infrastructure story:
- Create test script to verify all CRUD operations
- Manual verification that development server starts without issues
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality
- Use Prisma Studio (`npm run db:studio`) to visually verify database structure

### Important Notes

1. **DO NOT** modify any existing application code in this story
2. This story only sets up infrastructure - no API routes yet
3. The database will be empty except for seed data
4. SQLite file (`dev.db`) should NOT be committed to git
5. All database operations will be implemented in future stories

## QA Results

### QA Review Date: 2025-08-12
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
### Review Type: Comprehensive Technical & Quality Review

#### Overall Assessment: ✅ APPROVED WITH MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Verification
- ✅ **AC1**: Prisma ORM successfully installed and configured
- ✅ **AC2**: SQLite database set up in project root (dev.db)
- ✅ **AC3**: Database schema created with Website, ContentType, ContentItem models
- ✅ **AC4**: Database client singleton properly configured in `/lib/db/client.ts`
- ✅ **AC5**: Database scripts added to package.json
- ✅ **AC6**: CRUD operations verified through integration tests

### 2. Code Quality Review

#### Strengths:
- **Excellent Singleton Pattern**: The database client uses proper singleton pattern with global variable to prevent connection pool exhaustion during hot reload
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generated Prisma types
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with database logic isolated in `/lib/db`
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive integration tests covering all CRUD operations and relationships
- **Environment Management**: Proper separation of dev/test environments with `.env.local` and `.env.test`

#### Areas of Excellence:
- The developer proactively identified and fixed issues (erroneous "2" dependency in package.json)
- Proper cleanup of redundant files (test-helpers.ts, test-db.ts)
- Good documentation with inline comments explaining key patterns

### 3. Issues Found

#### Minor Issues:
1. **Missing tsx dependency**: The seed script uses `tsx` but it's not installed. Currently works with `npx tsx` but should add tsx as dev dependency for consistency
2. **setImmediate polyfill warning**: Jest tests show setImmediate warning (tests still pass, but should be addressed)
3. **SQLite JSON limitation**: Using String type instead of Json for SQLite - properly documented but should consider migration path for production

#### Recommendations:
1. Add tsx to devDependencies: `npm install --save-dev tsx`
2. Update seed script to use npx: `"db:seed": "npx tsx prisma/seed.ts"` 
3. Add setImmediate polyfill to jest.setup.js for cleaner test output
4. Consider adding cascade delete rules to schema for easier cleanup

### 4. Security Review
- ✅ Database files properly excluded from git (.gitignore)
- ✅ Environment variables used for database URLs
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- ✅ Proper connection cleanup in disconnect function

### 5. Performance Review
- ✅ Singleton pattern prevents connection pool exhaustion
- ✅ Appropriate logging levels (verbose in dev, errors only in prod)
- ✅ Efficient relationship definitions with proper indexes
- ✅ No N+1 query risks in current implementation

### 6. Testing Review
- ✅ Integration tests are well-structured and comprehensive
- ✅ Tests cover happy paths and edge cases
- ✅ Proper test database isolation
- ✅ Clean setup/teardown procedures
- ⚠️ Minor: setImmediate warning should be addressed for cleaner output

### 7. Documentation Review
- ✅ Clear inline documentation in code
- ✅ Comprehensive story documentation with implementation details
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
- ✅ Dev notes include important warnings about not committing database files

### 8. Best Practices Compliance
- ✅ Follows Prisma best practices for client management
- ✅ Proper error handling in seed script
- ✅ Conventional commit message structure ready
- ✅ Clean file organization following project structure

### Final Recommendations:
1. **MUST FIX**: Add tsx to devDependencies or update script to use npx
2. **SHOULD FIX**: Address setImmediate warning in Jest tests
3. **CONSIDER**: Add database backup/restore utilities for development
4. **FUTURE**: Plan migration strategy from SQLite to production database

### Conclusion:
The implementation is **solid and production-ready** for development environment. The developer has done excellent work setting up a robust database foundation with proper patterns, testing, and documentation. The minor issues identified do not block the story completion but should be addressed in a follow-up task or next story.

**QA VERDICT: APPROVED ✅**

Story can proceed to PR submission after addressing the tsx dependency issue.
