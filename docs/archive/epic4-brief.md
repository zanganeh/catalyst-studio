# Project Brief: Catalyst Studio Storage Migration

## Executive Summary

**Catalyst Studio Storage Migration Project**

This project involves migrating Catalyst Studio from browser-based local storage to a server-side SQL database solution. The primary problem being solved is the limitation and fragility of browser storage mechanisms, which restrict data persistence, sharing capabilities, and scalability. The target market is the existing Catalyst Studio user base and development team who require reliable, centralized data management. The key value proposition is providing robust, scalable data persistence with full CRUD operations while maintaining a modern, developer-friendly implementation approach.
- investigate all usage of local storage or any browser db storage and identify them
- them for each module create separate story (E.g. contnet types, content items, ...) and migrate them
- make sure to implement proper server side api to read data and expose the data to client and allow to update as well (full CRUD method)
- need to investigate to find best way to write data easily and modern mechanism for data managemement (e.g. good ORM that support CRUD in easy way), so we avoid implement lots of API's - you can consunlt with zen on any of these items
- we don't need to worry about security, rate calls, performance at this stage
- make sure to use gitflow for each story

## Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points**

Catalyst Studio currently relies entirely on browser local storage mechanisms (localStorage, sessionStorage, and potentially IndexedDB) for data persistence. This creates several critical limitations:

- **Data Loss Risk:** Browser storage can be cleared by users, browser updates, or storage quota limits
- **No Cross-Device Access:** Users cannot access their data from different devices or browsers
- **Limited Collaboration:** No ability to share data between team members or collaborate on projects
- **Storage Constraints:** Browser storage has size limitations (typically 5-10MB for localStorage)
- **No Backup/Recovery:** Data cannot be backed up centrally or recovered if lost
- **Limited Query Capabilities:** Browser storage lacks sophisticated querying and filtering options

**Impact of the Problem**

The current storage approach significantly impacts productivity and user experience. Users risk losing their work, cannot collaborate effectively, and are limited to single-device workflows. This prevents Catalyst Studio from scaling to support team environments or enterprise use cases.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short**

Browser storage was likely chosen initially for simplicity and to avoid backend infrastructure, but it fundamentally cannot support features like multi-user access, data synchronization, or proper data management that modern applications require.

**Urgency and Importance**

This migration is critical for Catalyst Studio's evolution from a single-user tool to a collaborative platform. Without this foundation, implementing any multi-user features, data analytics, or advanced functionality becomes impossible.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach**

Implement a comprehensive migration from browser local storage to a server-side SQL database with a modern ORM layer and RESTful API endpoints. The solution involves:

- **Systematic Discovery:** Audit all current local storage usage across the application to create a complete migration map
- **Modular Migration:** Break down the migration into discrete stories per functional module (content types, content items, etc.)
- **Modern Data Layer:** Implement a contemporary ORM solution that simplifies CRUD operations and reduces boilerplate API code
- **Full CRUD API:** Create standardized REST endpoints for all data entities with consistent patterns
- **Transparent Client Integration:** Ensure the client-side code can seamlessly transition to server-side storage with minimal refactoring

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions**

Unlike the current browser storage approach, this solution provides:
- Centralized, persistent data storage independent of browser state
- Unlimited storage capacity (relative to browser constraints)
- Professional data management capabilities including transactions, relationships, and complex queries
- Foundation for future multi-user and collaboration features

**Why This Solution Will Succeed**

The modular migration approach ensures manageable risk and allows for incremental validation. By leveraging modern ORM tools and established patterns, we avoid reinventing the wheel while maintaining flexibility. The explicit decision to defer security and performance optimization reduces initial complexity.

**High-level Vision**

Transform Catalyst Studio's data layer into a robust, scalable foundation that can support enterprise features, team collaboration, and advanced analytics while maintaining the current user experience during the transition.

- The existing codebase uses local storage in identifiable, modular patterns
- Client-side code can be modified to call APIs without major restructuring
- A modern ORM will significantly reduce API development effort
- The development team has basic familiarity with backend development
- All data currently in local storage can be represented in relational database tables
- The chosen ORM will handle basic data relationships and queries effectively
- Development can proceed module by module without breaking existing functionality

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Storage Pattern Complexity:** Current local storage usage might be more complex or scattered than anticipated, making modular migration difficult
- **ORM Learning Curve:** Team may need time to learn and effectively use the chosen ORM, potentially slowing initial development
- **API Design Consistency:** Without careful planning, different modules might implement inconsistent API patterns
- **Frontend Refactoring Scope:** Client-side changes might be more extensive than expected if storage logic is tightly coupled
- **Data Modeling Challenges:** Some local storage patterns might not translate cleanly to relational database structures

### Open Questions
- Which specific ORM should be selected? (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, etc.)
- Should the backend API live in the same repository or a separate one?
- What naming conventions should be used for API endpoints and database tables?
- Which SQL database is preferred for development and eventual deployment?
- How should the storage audit findings be documented and tracked?
