# Story 3.5: Recent Apps and Website Selection

## Status
Done

## Story
As a **user**,  
I want **to see and access my recently created websites**,  
so that **I can quickly resume work on existing projects**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Recent Apps section displays below the creation prompt
2. Website cards are clickable and navigate to studio
3. Cards show accurate last modified timestamps
4. Maximum 12 recent apps shown with "View All" option
5. Deleted websites are removed from recent apps

## Dev Notes
- This story builds on Story 3.3 (Dashboard Foundation) and Story 3.4 (AI-Powered Creation)
- Must integrate with browser storage from Story 3.1
- Must use ID-based routing from Story 3.2
- Recent apps should auto-update when websites are created/modified/deleted

## Tasks
- [x] Implement Recent Apps Component
  - [x] Create RecentApps component structure
  - [x] Add grid layout for website cards
  - [x] Implement card hover states and click handlers
- [x] Integrate Browser Storage
  - [x] Fetch website list from storage service
  - [x] Sort by last modified timestamp
  - [x] Limit display to 12 most recent
- [x] Website Card Display
  - [x] Show website name and icon/thumbnail
  - [x] Display last modified date in relative format
  - [x] Add brief description if available
- [x] Navigation Implementation
  - [x] Handle card clicks to navigate to /studio/{id}
  - [x] Pass website context through navigation
  - [x] Ensure smooth transition to studio
- [x] View All Functionality
  - [x] Add "View All" button when >12 websites exist
  - [x] Implement expanded view or pagination
- [x] Real-time Updates
  - [x] Subscribe to storage changes
  - [x] Auto-refresh when websites added/deleted
  - [x] Remove deleted websites from display
- [x] Write Tests
  - [x] Unit tests for RecentApps component
  - [x] Integration tests for storage interaction
  - [x] E2E tests for navigation flow

## Testing
- Verify Recent Apps displays correctly with 0, 1, 12, and 20+ websites
- Test card click navigation to correct studio context
- Verify real-time updates when creating/deleting websites
- Test "View All" functionality with various website counts
- Ensure proper handling of deleted websites
- Verify last modified timestamps update correctly

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Clicking a website loads correct context in studio
- IV2: Recent apps updates immediately after website creation
- IV3: Navigation between websites maintains data integrity

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation overall. The RecentApps component is well-structured with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and thoughtful UX considerations. The component correctly implements all acceptance criteria with clean, maintainable code that follows existing dashboard patterns.

Key strengths:
- Proper use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback)
- Good performance optimization with memoized storage service
- Comprehensive loading, error, and empty states
- Responsive grid layout with proper breakpoints
- Real-time updates via storage events
- Clean TypeScript interfaces

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: components/dashboard/recent-apps.tsx
  - **Change**: Consolidated event listener management using array iteration
  - **Why**: Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability
  - **How**: Used a const array to manage websiteEvents, making it easier to add/remove events in the future

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows existing patterns from dashboard components
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed in correct locations
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Event listener management refactored for better maintainability
[x] All tests passing after refactoring

No additional improvements needed - implementation is solid.

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Component properly:
- Uses router.push for navigation (no direct URL manipulation)
- Handles errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Relies on existing WebsiteStorageService for data access

### Performance Considerations

Good performance optimizations in place:
- Storage service instance memoized with useMemo
- LoadRecentWebsites callback memoized with useCallback
- Efficient sorting algorithm (O(n log n))
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Grid layout with CSS-based responsive breakpoints

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and proper integration with existing systems.
