# AI-Powered Content Management System Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.1
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Status**: Proof-of-Concept Validated ✅
- **Audience**: Product Managers, Solution Architects, Business Analysts, Scrum Masters, Development Team
- **POC Status**: Complete with 100% test success rate

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines requirements for integrating AI-powered content management capabilities into Catalyst Studio CMS, enabling the AI assistant to actively create and manage content rather than just providing advice.

### 1.2 Business Objective
Extend the existing AI chat interface with tool execution capabilities by adding a tools parameter to the OpenRouter/Vercel AI SDK integration, enabling direct database operations.

### 1.3 Key Finding from Research
Modern AI systems (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, bolt.diy) do NOT work by describing available tools in text prompts. Instead, they pass tools as structured code objects that AI models understand natively. This approach is more reliable, testable, and maintainable.

### 1.4 Proof-of-Concept Validation ✅
A complete isolated proof-of-concept has been built and tested, demonstrating:
- **100% test success rate** (6/6 automated tests passed)
- **Working AI tool calling** with OpenRouter + Vercel AI SDK
- **Multi-tool chaining** for complex operations
- **Full CRUD operations** on files (as proxy for database operations)
- **Location**: `/proof-of-concept/` directory with complete documentation
