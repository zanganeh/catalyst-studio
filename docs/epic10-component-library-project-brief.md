# Project Brief: CMS Component Library Foundation (Epic 10)

## Executive Overview

### Project Name
CMS Component Library Foundation - Epic 10

### Project Type
**PREMIUM FEATURE** - Component Library (Private Repository Only)

### Repository Requirements
- **Location**: All components MUST be under `/lib/premium/components/cms/`
- **Repository**: `catalyst-studio-premium` (private only)
- **Git Remote**: Always use `git push premium main`
- **Import Convention**: Use `@/lib/premium/components/cms/...` paths

### Strategic Context
This project establishes the foundation for Catalyst Studio's AI-powered website import system by creating a comprehensive library of 45 essential CMS components. These components will serve as the building blocks that enable automatic content mapping and site reconstruction, covering patterns found on 90% of content-focused websites.

### Business Opportunity
Currently, with only 4 basic components (15% coverage), the platform cannot effectively map and import real-world websites. This limitation prevents users from migrating existing sites to our platform, creating a significant barrier to adoption. By expanding to 45 strategically selected components, we unlock the ability to import and reconstruct most CMS-based websites automatically.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- **Limited Component Coverage**: Only 4 components (hero, header, footer, CTA) available
- **Import System Blocked**: Cannot map 85% of typical website content patterns
- **User Migration Barrier**: Users cannot bring existing sites to platform
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors offer more comprehensive component libraries

### Desired Future State
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 45 components covering 90% of CMS website patterns
- **AI-Ready Components**: Each component designed with detection helpers for automatic mapping
- **Complete Site Building**: Users can construct full CMS websites without custom coding
- **Seamless Migration Path**: Import system can successfully map and recreate existing sites

### Impact of Not Acting
- Import feature (Epic 11) cannot be built effectively
- Content builder (Epic 12) will have limited utility
- Platform adoption hindered by migration barriers
- Competitive position weakened in CMS market

## Strategic Alignment

### Business Goals Supported
1. **Platform Adoption**: Enable easy migration from existing CMS platforms
2. **Market Positioning**: Compete effectively with established CMS solutions
3. **User Success**: Provide comprehensive tools for complete site building
4. **AI Innovation**: Enable intelligent content recognition and mapping

### Key Performance Indicators
- Import system success rate: Target 80% content mapping accuracy
- Component reuse rate: Target 70% across projects
- Support ticket volume: Under 5% related to missing components
- Rendering performance: All components under 50ms render time

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
**45 Essential Components across 11 Categories:**

1. **Navigation (5)**: Nav bar, footer, mobile menu, breadcrumbs, search
2. **Heroes & Headers (4)**: Banner, split, minimal, video backgrounds
3. **Content Display (8)**: Text blocks, layouts, galleries, video, accordions
4. **Features & Services (4)**: Feature grids, lists, showcases, process steps
5. **Call-to-Actions (3)**: CTA banners, newsletters, button groups
6. **Social Proof (4)**: Testimonials, logos, reviews
7. **Contact & Forms (4)**: Contact forms, info displays, maps
8. **About & Team (3)**: Team grids, member profiles, about sections
9. **Blog & Articles (5)**: Blog lists, cards, headers, author bios
10. **Pricing (2)**: Pricing tables and cards
11. **Data Display (3)**: Stats, tables, timelines

**Technical Requirements:**
- Mobile responsive (320px to 1440px+)
- Accessibility compliant
- AI detection helpers
- Performance optimized

### Out of Scope
- E-commerce specific components (product catalogs, carts, checkout)
- Advanced interactive components (calculators, configurators)
- Third-party integrations beyond basic embeds
- Custom component creation interface
- Component theming system (future epic)

### Assumptions
- Database schema supports component storage
- Existing rendering pipeline can handle new components
- Team has React/TypeScript expertise
- Design system guidelines exist

### Constraints
- Must complete before Epic 11 (Import System)
- 5-week implementation timeline
- **PREMIUM ONLY**: Private repository, never in public repo and premieum feature enable into premeium folders as per Claude.md
- **File Structure**: Must follow `/lib/premium/components/cms/` hierarchy
- **Git Workflow**: Only push to `premium` remote, never `origin`
- Cannot exceed 45 components (scope control)

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Delivery

**Phase 1: Core 20 Components (Weeks 1-2)**
- Critical components appearing on every website
- Foundation for import system testing
- Immediate value delivery

**Phase 2: Extended 15 Components (Weeks 3-4)**
- Add variety and flexibility
- Cover specialized use cases
- Enable complete site building

**Phase 3: Final 10 Components (Week 5)**
- Complete coverage for edge cases
- Specialized components
- Polish and optimization

### Technical Architecture
- **CRITICAL Location**: `/lib/premium/components/cms/` (NOT in common components)
- **Structure**: Category-based folders under cms/ directory
- **Repository Rules**: Follow CLAUDE.md premium feature guidelines
- **Import Paths**: Always use `@/lib/premium/components/cms/category/component`
- **Demo Location**: `/app/premium/demo/cms-components/`
- **Test Location**: `/lib/premium/components/cms/__tests__/`

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders
