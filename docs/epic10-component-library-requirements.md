# Epic 10: CMS Component Library Foundation - Requirements Document

> **PREMIUM FEATURE** - All components under `/lib/premium/components/`  
> **Priority**: P0 - Must complete before Epic 11 (Import) and Epic 12 (Builder)

## Executive Summary

This epic establishes a focused CMS component library with **45 essential components** that will enable our AI-powered import system to successfully map website content. Based on industry research, these components cover the patterns found on 90% of content-focused websites.

## The Problem We're Solving

Currently, we have only 4 basic components (hero, header, footer, cta) which covers about 15% of typical website patterns. For our import system to work effectively, we need components that match what real CMS websites actually use.

## Evidence-Based Component Priorities

### Key Research Findings

**Navigation is Critical**
- 94% of users say easy navigation is the most important website feature
- 38% of visitors look at navigation links first when visiting a new site

**Hero Sections Drive Engagement**
- 87% of SaaS websites use hero sections as their primary messaging tool
- Most visitors never scroll past the hero section
- Adding key functionality to hero sections increased conversions by 15%

**Mobile Responsiveness is Non-Negotiable**
- 61% of global website traffic comes from mobile devices
- 74% of people are more likely to return to mobile-friendly sites

**Content and Forms Matter**
- 59% of users abandon poorly designed forms
- 92% of consumers read reviews and testimonials before purchasing
- Forms with fewer fields typically convert better

## Why 45 Components is the Right Number

**Too Few (15-25)**: Can't handle common patterns, import fails often
**Just Right (45)**: Covers 90% of CMS sites without overwhelming users
**Too Many (100+)**: Confusing, hard to maintain, most never used

Our research shows 45 components hits the sweet spot for CMS-focused websites, excluding e-commerce complexity while covering all essential content patterns.

### Real-World Validation

We tested our component list against actual websites and confirmed coverage. For example, a shopping center website uses these components from our library:
- Navigation Bar with menu items
- Hero image section
- Text blocks for content
- Card Grid for events/stores
- Logo Strip for store brands
- Newsletter Signup form
- Footer with contact info
- Two-Column Layouts

This real site used only 12 of our 45 components, validating that we have comprehensive coverage with room for variety.

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Database schema for component storage
- Import system (Epic 11) needs Phase 1 complete
- Content builder (Epic 12) needs component APIs

### Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to 45 components, no additions
- **Over-engineering**: Start simple, enhance later
- **Performance**: Lazy load components as needed

## Next Steps

1. Approve the 45 component list
2. Design Phase 1 components (20 core)
3. Build proof of concept with 5 components
4. Test with import system prototype
5. Complete all phases based on learnings
