# Story 7.6: Update Application Layer & Testing

## Status
Apprved

## Estimation
3 days

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the application layer to use only the provider interface,  
**so that** the system is truly platform-agnostic.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All direct Optimizely calls replaced with provider calls
2. Provider injection configured at application bootstrap
3. Mock provider created for testing
4. Integration tests updated for provider pattern
5. Environment configuration for provider selection

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All direct Optimizely API calls removed from application layer
- [ ] Provider interface is the only CMS interaction point
- [ ] Mock provider enables testing without real CMS
- [ ] All existing functionality works identically
- [ ] Provider can be switched via environment variable
- [ ] Integration tests pass with both real and mock providers
- [ ] No performance degradation measured
- [ ] Documentation updated with provider usage
- [ ] PR approved by tech lead

## Success Metrics
- Zero direct CMS references outside provider module
- 100% test coverage with mock provider
- All existing features work unchanged
- Provider switch takes < 5 seconds
- No increase in API response times

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Hidden Optimizely dependencies difficult to find
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic search for all Optimizely imports and API calls
- **Risk**: Mock provider behavior differs from real provider
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration test suite validates both
- **Risk**: Performance overhead from abstraction layer
  - **Mitigation**: Profile critical paths, optimize hot code paths

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 7.4 Dev Agent Record]

Story 7.4 successfully implemented the AI integration layer with:
- Dynamic type loading system in `lib/services/universal-types/`
- Universal type context builder with session awareness
- Integration tests in `__tests__/prompts/universal-type-generation.test.ts`
- Platform capability matrix for type transformations

The provider interface from earlier stories (7.1-7.3) is now stable and ready for application layer integration.

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md]

#### Provider Registry Pattern
The provider registry manages provider instances and selection:
```typescript
interface IProviderRegistry {
  register(provider: ICMSProvider): void;
  getProvider(id?: string): ICMSProvider;
  setDefault(id: string): void;
}
```

#### ICMSProvider Interface
[Source: Story 7.1 implementation]
All providers must implement this interface:
```typescript
interface ICMSProvider {
  id: string;
  getContentTypes(): Promise<UniversalContentType[]>;
  createContentType(type: UniversalContentType): Promise<void>;
  updateContentType(id: string, type: UniversalContentType): Promise<void>;
  deleteContentType(id: string): Promise<void>;
  // ... additional methods
}
```

#### Application Layer Integration Points
[Source: Current codebase analysis]

Key files requiring refactoring:
- `lib/services/content-type-service.ts` - Direct Optimizely calls
- `app/api/content-types/route.ts` - API handlers with CMS logic
- `components/content-builder/*.tsx` - Components with CMS dependencies
- `lib/stores/content-store.ts` - State management with CMS data

#### Mock Provider Requirements
The mock provider should:
- Return consistent test data for all methods
- Support configurable responses for different test scenarios
- Simulate network delays (optional)
- Track method calls for test assertions
- Provide reset functionality between tests

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md#testing-strategy]

- **Framework:** Jest 30.0.5 for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Location:** Tests co-located in `__tests__` folders
- **Coverage Target:** 90% for provider-related code
- **Mock Strategy:** Use mock provider for all unit tests
- **Integration Tests:** Test with both real and mock providers
- **Pattern:** Follow existing test patterns from codebase

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('Application with Provider', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    registry.register(new MockProvider());
    registry.setDefault('mock');
  });

  it('should work with mock provider', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Provider Injection Strategy:**
   - Use React Context for component-level access
   - Dependency injection for service-level access
   - Environment variable for provider selection
   - Fallback chain: ENV → Config → Mock

2. **Refactoring Approach:**
   - Start with least critical components
   - Maintain parallel old/new code paths initially
   - Use feature flags if needed for gradual rollout
   - Remove old code only after validation

3. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
   - Don't leak provider-specific types to app layer
   - Ensure mock provider matches real provider behavior exactly
   - Avoid tight coupling between providers and app logic
   - Keep provider interface minimal and focused

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Cache provider instances (singleton pattern)
   - Lazy load providers to reduce startup time
   - Use connection pooling for API calls
   - Profile before and after to ensure no regression
