## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion:
- Feature flag system working well for gradual rollout
- React Context pattern effective for state management
- Framer Motion animations performing well
- localStorage persistence pattern established
- Performance optimizations with React.memo proven effective
- PostMessage security patterns may be useful for cross-view communication

### Architecture Context

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture]

**NavigationSidebar Component**
- **Responsibility:** Application navigation with expandable sections
- **Current Implementation:** Basic navigation in `components/navigation/navigation-sidebar.tsx`
- **Enhancement Required:** Add expandable sections and view management
- **Integration Points:** 
  - Must preserve existing navigation items
  - Integrate with feature flag system
  - Connect to new view routes

**Key Interfaces:**
- `useNavigationState()` - Navigation expansion and view state
- `NavigationSection` - Expandable section containers
- `ViewRouter` - View switching and route management

**Technology Stack:** 
- Next.js App Router for routing
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Context for state management
- localStorage for persistence

#### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md - Inferred from requirements]

**Navigation Section Model**
```typescript
interface NavigationSection {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  icon: React.ReactNode;
  expanded: boolean;
  items: NavigationItem[];
  featureFlag?: FeatureName;
}

interface NavigationItem {
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  badge?: string | number;
  featureFlag?: FeatureName;
  children?: NavigationItem[];
}

interface NavigationState {
  expandedSections: string[];
  activeView: ViewType;
  searchQuery: string;
  lastVisited: Record<ViewType, string>;
}

enum ViewType {
  Overview = 'overview',
  Content = 'content',
  Analytics = 'analytics',
  Development = 'development',
  Integrations = 'integrations'
}
```

#### View Structure
[Source: PRD and architecture.md]

**Required Views:**
1. **Overview** - Dashboard with project summary and quick actions
2. **Content** - Content type management and content editing (existing from Story 1.3)
3. **Analytics** - Placeholder page with "Coming Soon" message (full implementation deferred to post-MVP)
4. **Development** - Source code view preparation (full implementation in Story 1.9)
5. **Integrations** - CMS integration preparation (full implementation in Story 1.10)

Each view should:
- Have its own route under `app/(dashboard)/`
- Include view-specific layout if needed
- Integrate with feature flag system
- Support deep linking

#### Integration Points
[Source: architecture.md]

**With Existing Components:**
- Must work with existing `LayoutContainer` from Story 1.1
- Integrate with `ProjectContext` from Story 1.2
- Coordinate with `ContentTypeContext` from Story 1.3
- Support `PreviewContext` from Story 1.4
- Use existing feature flag system

**Navigation Enhancement Requirements:**
- Current navigation is flat - needs hierarchical structure
- Preserve existing nav items while adding sections
- Maintain Catalyst X visual identity (orange accent #FF5500)
- Glass morphism effects from Story 1.1c
- Smooth animations (200-300ms transitions)

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Requirements]
- Navigation interactions must be instant (<100ms)
- View switches should complete within 500ms
- Animations must maintain 60fps
- Use CSS transforms for animations, not JavaScript
- Implement React.memo for navigation components
- Consider virtual scrolling for long navigation lists

#### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Security]
- Validate route access based on feature flags
- Sanitize any user-provided navigation labels
- Prevent navigation to unauthorized views
- Secure localStorage data (no sensitive information)

#### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: PRD and approved mockup]
- Maintain three-column layout (360px navigation width)
- Glass morphism with backdrop-blur effects
- Smooth hover and active state transitions
- Color palette: #FF5500 (orange), #212121 (dark), #0077CC (blue), #00AA55 (green)
- Inter font family with appropriate weights
- Geometric patterns as design element
- Expandable sections with smooth height animations
- Clear visual hierarchy with indentation

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

- Test files location: `tests/navigation-management.spec.ts`
- Use Playwright for E2E testing of navigation flows
- Test all view switches and transitions
- Verify persistence across sessions
- Test with feature flags enabled/disabled
- Specific test scenarios:
  - Section expand/collapse behavior
  - Active state detection accuracy
  - View transition performance
  - Mobile navigation drawer
  - Keyboard navigation coverage
  - Search functionality
  - Deep linking to views
