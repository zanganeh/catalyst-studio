# Story 7.5: Migration & Transformation Engine

## Status
Draft

## Estimation
5 days

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a migration engine that transforms content types between platforms,  
**so that** content types can be ported with confidence scoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Transformation rules defined for all type mappings
2. Confidence scoring algorithm implemented (0-100)
3. Migration report generation with warnings
4. Graceful degradation strategies implemented
5. Real-world transformation examples documented

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All transformation rules implemented for three-layer type system
- [ ] Confidence scoring algorithm calculates accurate scores
- [ ] Migration reports generate detailed warnings for data loss
- [ ] Degradation strategies handle incompatible types gracefully
- [ ] 5+ real-world transformation examples documented
- [ ] Integration tests passing for transformations
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by team
- [ ] PR approved by tech lead

## Success Metrics
- Transformation confidence scoring accuracy >90%
- All primitive types map successfully across platforms
- Common patterns have defined fallback strategies
- Migration reports clearly indicate potential data loss
- Round-trip transformations maintain data integrity where possible
- Transform 100 content types in <1 second (performance target)
- Memory usage stays under 512MB for large transformations

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complex field types don't map cleanly between platforms
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback strategies and clear warning system
- **Risk**: Confidence scoring too conservative or optimistic
  - **Mitigation**: Calibrate based on real transformation results
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large content types
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize transformation logic, implement caching
- **Risk**: Malicious input in type definitions causing injection attacks
  - **Mitigation**: Input validation and sanitization for all transformations

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 7.4 Dev Agent Record]

Story 7.4 successfully implemented:
- AI system prompt templates in `prompts/universal-types/`
- Validation system with type validator at `prompts/universal-types/validation/type-validator.ts`
- Confidence scoring foundation at `lib/providers/universal/confidence/scorer.ts`
- AI metadata tracking at `lib/providers/universal/metadata/ai-tracking.ts`
- Universal type definitions enhanced with AI metadata in `lib/providers/universal/types.ts`

The confidence scoring system from Story 7.4 should be extended and integrated with the migration engine. The validation system can be leveraged for pre-transformation validation.

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md]

#### Three-Layer Type System
**Layer 1: Universal Primitives**
- text, longText, number, boolean, date, json, decimal
- These map directly to most platforms with high confidence

**Layer 2: Common Patterns**  
- richText, media, collection, component, select, repeater, slug, tags
- Platform-specific implementations vary, require transformation rules

**Layer 3: Platform Extensions**
- Platform-specific features that may not have direct equivalents
- Require fallback strategies and confidence scoring

#### Platform Capability Matrix
[Source: Epic 7 PRD, Appendix B]

| CMS Platform | Pages Equivalent | Components Equivalent | Dynamic Areas | Nested Components | Max Depth |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Strapi | Collection/Single Types | Components | Dynamic Zones | ✅ (limited) | Unlimited |
| Contentful | Entries with URLs | Modular Blocks | Reference Fields | ✅ | 10 levels |
| Sanity | Documents w/ Routes | Portable Text Blocks | Arrays | ✅ | Unlimited |
| Optimizely | Pages (Routable) | Blocks | Content Areas | ✅ | Unlimited |

#### Key Technical Components
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md#component-architecture]

**UniversalTypeMapper Responsibilities:**
- Transform fields between universal and platform-specific formats
- Calculate migration confidence scores
- Generate fallback strategies for incompatible types

**Integration Points:**
- Uses existing `UniversalContentType` and `UniversalField` interfaces
- Integrates with `lib/providers/universal/types.ts`
- Works with provider-specific mappers (e.g., OptimizelyTypeMapper)

#### Transformation Requirements
[Source: Epic 7 PRD, FR5, FR8, FR9]

- **FR5:** Field type mapping with at least 80% success rate across platforms
- **FR8:** Migration confidence scoring (0-100) with detailed warnings
- **FR9:** Graceful degradation strategies: best match, flatten, preserve, document

#### File Structure
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md#new-file-organization]

lib/providers/
  universal/
    mapping/           # UniversalTypeMapper
    confidence/        # Confidence scoring (extend existing)
    migration/         # Migration reporter
    fallback/          # Degradation strategies

    mapping/           # OptimizelyTypeMapper
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md#testing-strategy]

- **Framework:** Jest 30.0.5 for unit tests
- **Location:** Co-located in `__tests__` folders
- **Coverage Target:** 90% for provider code
- **Integration Tests:** Test transformation round-trips
- **Pattern:** Use existing test patterns from codebase

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Confidence Scoring Calibration:**
   - 100%: Perfect match, no data loss
   - 90-99%: Minor differences, cosmetic only  
   - 70-89%: Some feature differences, but functional
   - 50-69%: Significant differences, manual review needed
   - <50%: Major incompatibility, transformation not recommended

2. **Fallback Strategy Selection:**
   - Rich text → Markdown (flatten strategy)
   - Complex components → JSON storage (preserve strategy)
   - Platform-specific → Comments/metadata (document strategy)
   - Unknown types → Closest primitive (best-match strategy)

3. **Migration Report Sections:**
   - Executive summary with overall confidence
   - Field-by-field mapping table
   - Warnings for potential data loss
   - Recommendations for manual interventions
   - Platform capability comparison

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Cache transformation rules for repeated use
   - Lazy-load platform-specific mappers
   - Optimize confidence calculations for large types
   - Monitor memory usage during large batch transformations
   - Implement streaming for very large content type collections

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - Validate all input type definitions before transformation
   - Sanitize field names and values to prevent injection
   - Escape special characters in generated output
   - Never execute dynamic code from type definitions
   - Log all transformation operations for audit trail
