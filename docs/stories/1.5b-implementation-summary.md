## Visual Results

- Multiple nested scrollbars causing confusion
- No centralized design system

### After
- ✅ Consistent dark theme across all pages
- ✅ Catalyst X orange accent (#FF5500) used consistently
- ✅ Glass morphism effects with backdrop blur

- Consistent use across all pages
- Brand identity maintained throughout

### NFR5: Glass Morphism Effects ✅
- Backdrop blur effects implemented
- Semi-transparent surfaces with proper layering
- Smooth transitions with cubic-bezier easing

## Testing Results

- Visual inspection completed via Playwright
- Screenshots captured for all major pages
- Dark theme consistency verified
- Scrolling behavior improved
- No functionality regression observed

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Settings Page**: Not yet created, will need dark theme when implemented
2. **Custom Scrollbar Styling**: Could be enhanced with custom scrollbar colors
3. **Animation Performance**: Glass morphism effects working well, no performance issues observed
4. **Component Library**: Design system tokens now available for all future components

## Conclusion

Story 1.5b has been successfully completed. The application now has a consistent, professional dark theme that adheres to the Catalyst X visual identity. All PRD requirements for NFR1 and NFR5 have been met, and the user experience has been significantly improved with the single scroll container implementation.

The design system foundation is now in place for all future development, ensuring consistency and maintainability moving forward.
