## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/5-2-website-management-tools (CONTINUING EXISTING BRANCH)
Base Branch: main (NOTE: Repository uses 'main' not 'develop')
PR Target: main

**Note on Branch Strategy**: Epic 5 stories (5.1-5.6) are using a shared feature branch to maintain continuity across the epic implementation and avoid merge conflicts between interdependent stories.

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
2. Pull: `git pull origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
5. PR: Update existing PR with Story 5.5 implementation

### Technical Architecture Context

**Previous Story Insights** [From Stories 5.1-5.4]:
- Tool infrastructure successfully implemented with Vercel AI SDK
- Business rules engine at `/lib/ai-tools/business-rules.ts`
- All 10 tools implemented: 3 website, 4 content type, 3 content item tools
- Context provider at `/lib/ai-tools/context/context-provider.ts`
- Tool registry at `/lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts` with `allTools` export
- Performance monitoring pattern established (<2s requirement)
- Transaction support for atomic operations

**Current Chat Implementation** [Source: /app/api/chat/route.ts]:
- **ALREADY HAS TOOL INTEGRATION** - The chat route is already enhanced!
- Uses `streamText` from Vercel AI SDK with tools parameter
- Includes `allTools` from tool registry
- Has context loading from `loadWebsiteContext`
- Implements `toolChoice: 'auto'` for automatic tool selection
- Supports multi-step operations with `maxSteps: 5`
- Has `onStepFinish` callback for logging tool executions

**Key Finding**: The backend is already fully integrated. This story focuses on UI/UX enhancements for better tool execution feedback.

**Chat UI Components** [Source: /components/chat/]:
- `base-chat.tsx` - Core chat interface component
- `ai-context-chat.tsx` - Context-aware chat wrapper
- `enhanced-chat-panel.tsx` - Enhanced chat features
- `chat-persistence.tsx` - Chat history management
- `chat-with-persistence.tsx` - Persistent chat wrapper

**Streaming Response Integration** [Source: Vercel AI SDK]:
- Uses `useChat` hook for streaming responses
- Supports real-time message updates
- Handles tool execution results in stream
- Provides `isLoading` state for UI feedback

**UI Enhancement Requirements** [Source: epic-5-prd.md]:
- Display tool execution progress in real-time
- Show clear success/failure indicators
- Maintain existing chat formatting
- Provide actionable error messages
- Display what was created/modified

**Error Handling Patterns** [From previous stories]:
```typescript
try {
  // Tool execution
} catch (error) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
  };
}
```

**Success Response Pattern** [From tools]:
```typescript
return {
  success: true,
  data: createdItem,
  message: `Successfully created ${itemType} "${itemName}"`
};
```

**Chat Message Types** [Inferred from UI]:
- User messages
- Assistant text responses
- Tool execution indicators
- Tool result displays
- Error messages
- Success confirmations

### UI/UX Implementation Guidelines

**Visual Hierarchy & States**:
```typescript
interface ToolExecutionUI {
  icon: '🔧' | '✨' | '📝';  // Tool-specific icons
  title: string;  // Specific action (e.g., "Creating Blog Post Type")
  progress?: number;  // Percentage if available
  substeps?: string[];  // Multi-step visibility
  estimatedTime?: string;  // Set expectations (e.g., "~2 seconds")
  state: 'pending' | 'executing' | 'success' | 'error';
  background: {
    pending: 'bg-gray-50',
    executing: 'bg-blue-50 border-blue-300 animate-pulse',
    success: 'bg-green-50 border-green-300',
    error: 'bg-red-50 border-red-300'
  };
}
```

**Progress Indicators**:
- Skeleton screens for anticipated content structure
- Step counters for multi-step operations (e.g., "Step 2 of 3")
- Progress bars with percentage for bulk operations
- Estimated time remaining for longer operations
- Cancel button for operations >3 seconds

**Success Confirmations**:
- Green accent (#10B981) with animated checkmark icon
- Clear description: "✅ Successfully created Blog Post content type with 5 fields"
- Include relevant IDs or names for reference
- Show what was modified with before/after when applicable
- Brief success animation (300ms fade-in)

**Error Recovery Pattern**:
```typescript
interface ErrorDisplay {
  level: 'warning' | 'error';
  message: string;  // User-friendly
  details?: string;  // Technical details (collapsible)
  actions: [
    { label: 'Retry', action: () => void, variant: 'primary' },
    { label: 'Modify Request', action: () => void, variant: 'secondary' },
    { label: 'Get Help', action: () => void, variant: 'ghost' }
  ];
}
```

**Streaming Updates**:
- Smooth transitions between states (200ms ease-in-out)
- Progressive disclosure of results as they stream
- Stagger animations for bulk results (50ms delay between items)
- Maintain scroll position with smooth auto-scroll for new content
- Collapsible sections for verbose tool outputs

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- ARIA live regions: `aria-live="polite"` for updates
- Role attributes: `role="status"` for progress, `role="alert"` for errors
- Focus management: Return focus to input after tool completion
- Keyboard shortcuts: Escape to cancel, Enter to retry
- High contrast mode support with forced-colors media query

**Motion & Micro-interactions**:
- Smooth transitions between states (not jarring jumps)
- Stagger animations for bulk results (50ms between items)
- Subtle progress animations (pulsing border, not aggressive spinners)
- Success celebrations (brief 300ms scale animation, not annoying)
- Loading shimmer effect for skeleton screens
- Smooth scroll-to-bottom when new content appears
- Hover states on interactive elements with 150ms transition

### Testing Standards

**Test Coverage**:
- UI component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for chat-tool interaction
- E2E tests with Playwright for full flow
- Performance tests for streaming responses

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Single tool execution with success
2. Multi-step tool chain execution
3. Tool execution with validation errors
4. Network error handling
5. Concurrent tool executions
6. Large result set handling
7. Chat history with tool results

### Project Structure Notes
- Chat UI components in `/components/chat/`
- Chat API route at `/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Hooks in `/hooks/` for chat functionality
- Storage models in `/lib/storage/`
- No new API endpoints needed - enhancement is UI-focused
