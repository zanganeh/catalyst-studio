# Story 5.4: Content Item Management Tools

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** content creator,  
**I want** to create and manage content items via AI commands,  
**so that** I can rapidly populate my website with content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `list-content-items` retrieves items with filtering options
2. `create-content-item` adds new content with validation
3. `update-content-item` modifies existing content safely
4. Bulk operations limited to 20 items per request
5. All operations respect content type field definitions
