# Story 2.5: Update Test Suite to Remove Feature Flag Dependencies

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to update all tests to work without feature flags,
**so that** our test suite accurately tests the production behavior of all Epic 1 features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove all feature flag mocks from unit tests
2. Update integration tests to test features directly
3. Rewrite end-to-end tests to test all features as permanently enabled
4. Remove feature flag test utilities and helpers
5. Update test setup and configuration files
6. Ensure E2E tests for source code view and other Epic 1 features run without flags

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 Completion Notes]
- Story 2.2 removed core infrastructure and created stub files
- Story 2.3 removed feature flags from all UI components
- Story 2.4 verified no server-side feature flags exist
- Components now render all features permanently
- Stub files (`/config/features-stub.ts`) may still be imported by tests

### Test Files to Modify
[Source: docs/feature-flag-audit.md#Test Files]

**Unit Tests:**
- `/__tests__/features.test.ts` - Tests feature flag system itself (DELETE)
- `/__tests__/components.test.tsx` - Component tests with feature mocks

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**
- `/tests/features/deployment-simple.spec.ts` - Deployment tests
- `/tests/features/persistence.spec.ts` - Persistence tests
- `/tests/preview-system.spec.ts` - Preview system tests
- `/tests/content-type-builder.spec.ts` - Content type builder tests
- `/tests/content-builder-persistence.spec.ts` - Content builder persistence

### Common Test Patterns to Remove
[Source: docs/feature-flag-audit.md#localStorage Usage Analysis]

**localStorage Manipulation Pattern:**
```javascript
// REMOVE patterns like this:
await page.evaluate(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('featureFlags', JSON.stringify({
    enhancedChat: true,
    contentBuilder: true,
    // etc...
  }));
});
```

**Mock Setup Pattern:**
```javascript
// REMOVE patterns like this:
jest.mock('@/config/features', () => ({
  isFeatureEnabled: jest.fn(() => true),
  enableFeature: jest.fn(),
  disableFeature: jest.fn()
}));
```

### Testing Framework Details
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]

**Test Frameworks:**
- **Unit Tests:** Jest with React Testing Library
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright
- **Test Commands:**
  - Unit: `npm test` or `npm run test:unit`
  - E2E: `npm run test:e2e` or `npx playwright test`
  - Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

### Testing Standards
[Source: testing-guide.md]
- Tests should reflect production behavior
- No conditional test logic based on feature flags
- All Epic 1 features should be tested as enabled
- Maintain or improve test execution time
- Maintain or improve test coverage metrics

### Important Notes
1. **Test File Deletion:** `/__tests__/features.test.ts` should be deleted entirely as it tests the feature flag system itself
2. **Stub File Usage:** Tests may still import from `/config/features-stub.ts` - these imports can be removed
3. **Performance:** Removing feature flag checks should improve test execution time
4. **Coverage:** Ensure test coverage doesn't drop after removing conditional test paths

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All tests pass after feature flag removal
- **IV2**: Test execution time is maintained or improved
- **IV3**: Test coverage metrics are maintained or increased

- **Mock Removal**: All `jest.mock('@/config/features')` statements eliminated
- **FeatureFlagProvider**: No remaining references to feature flag context
- **Import Cleanup**: No imports from `@/config/features` or `features-stub` in tests

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues Found
1. **Test Separation**: Jest config correctly updated to exclude Playwright tests (`/tests/`)
2. **File Organization**: Integration test moved from Playwright to Jest directory appropriately

#### üéØ Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Impact**: Test suite now accurately reflects production behavior
- **Performance**: Expected improvement from removing conditional logic
- **Maintainability**: Improved - simpler test structure without flag conditions

#### üìä Metrics
- Files Modified: 9
- Files Deleted: 1  
- Files Moved: 1
- Feature Flag References Removed: 100%

#### ‚úÖ Final Verdict: APPROVED
Story 2.5 has been successfully implemented with high quality. All acceptance criteria met, code is clean, and the test suite is now properly aligned with the production state where all Epic 1 features are permanently enabled.

**Recommendations for Future Work:**
1. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to prevent reintroduction of feature flags
2. Document the permanent feature state in the main README
3. Consider performance benchmarking to quantify the improvement from flag removal
