### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 4.7 - AI Context Database Implementation]

**Key learnings from recent database implementations:**
- Database setup uses Prisma with SQLite for development
- All models follow consistent patterns with id, websiteId, timestamps
- Migration process is standardized with Prisma
- Test framework uses Jest + React Testing Library
- API routes follow Next.js App Router conventions in `/app/api/`

### Database Configuration
[Source: epic4-architecture.md#Database Integration]

**Database Setup:**
- Development: SQLite database file stored in project root (git-ignored)
- Production: PostgreSQL/MySQL via environment variables
- ORM: Prisma for all database operations
- Connection: Singleton pattern in `/lib/db/client.ts`

**Environment Variables:**
```env
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# .env.production
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

### Package.json Scripts Reference
[Source: epic4-architecture.md#Package.json Scripts]

**Current recommended scripts structure:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "db:generate": "prisma generate",
    "db:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
    "db:seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

### Existing Database Models
[Source: Previous stories 4.2-4.7]

**Models to include in seed data:**
1. **Website**: id, name, description, category, metadata, createdAt, updatedAt
2. **ContentType**: id, websiteId, name, fields (JSON), settings (JSON), timestamps
3. **ContentItem**: id, contentTypeId, websiteId, data (JSON), status, timestamps
4. **AIContext**: id, websiteId, sessionId, messages (JSON), metadata, isActive, timestamps

**Note**: Refer to `prisma/schema.prisma` for the complete and current model definitions including all field types, relations, and constraints when implementing seed data.

### Development Workflow Integration
[Source: epic4-architecture.md#Build Process Integration]

**Key Requirements:**
- Next.js dev server handles everything - no separate backend server
- `npm run dev` runs Next.js which serves both frontend and API
- Database migrations run as part of dev setup script
- Development uses SQLite with automatic setup
- All database operations integrate seamlessly with existing workflow

### Testing Standards
[Source: Stories 4.2-4.5 patterns]

**Test Configuration:**
- Test framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Test file location: `__tests__` folders with `.test.ts` suffix
- Coverage requirement: Maintain existing coverage levels
- Database testing: Use test database, clean state for each test

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 4.8:**
- Test all npm scripts work correctly
- Verify seed data creates valid database state
- Test reset scripts handle edge cases
- Validate setup process on clean environment
- Ensure documentation examples are accurate

### Important Notes

1. **Development Experience Focus**: This story is about making the development environment smooth and efficient
2. **No Production Changes**: All changes are development-only, no production deployment affected
3. **Documentation Quality**: Clear, accurate documentation is critical for team onboarding
4. **Script Reliability**: All scripts must be idempotent and handle errors gracefully
5. **Tool Recommendations**: Focus on free/open-source tools that work cross-platform
