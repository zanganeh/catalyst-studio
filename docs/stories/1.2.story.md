# Story 1.2: Enhance AI Chat with Structured Workflows

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the AI chat to guide me through website creation with structured prompts,
**so that** I can easily describe and refine my website requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structured prompt templates implemented for website generation
2. Suggestion chips provide quick actions (Add Newsletter, More Content, Deploy)
3. Typing indicator shows when AI is processing
4. Conversation history properly managed with user/AI message styling
5. Context-aware responses based on project state

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing OpenRouter and Vercel AI SDK integration continues working
- IV2: Chat maintains visual design from mockup exactly
- IV3: Response times remain under 2 seconds for UI updates

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 0: Git Setup and Branch Creation

### Task 9: Review Cycle (Fix-Forward Approach)
- [ ] Code Review Phase:
  - [ ] Address ALL reviewer comments on same branch
  - [ ] Push fixes to same feature branch
  - [ ] Re-run all manual tests after fixes
  - [ ] Re-request review
  - [ ] Continue until approved (no issues remaining)
- [ ] QA Review Phase:
  - [ ] QA validates all acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Fix any QA issues on same branch
  - [ ] Re-test after fixes
  - [ ] Continue until QA approved
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: Never revert - always fix forward on same branch!

### Task 10: Final Merge Process
- [ ] Verify all manual checks passing one final time
- [ ] Ensure code review approved (at least 1 approval)
- [ ] Confirm QA validation complete
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts with main
- [ ] Update PR description with final test results
- [ ] Perform squash merge: `git merge --squash feature/story-1.2-enhanced-chat`
- [ ] Use commit message: "Story 1.2: Enhance AI Chat with Structured Workflows (#PR-number)"
- [ ] Update story status to "Done" in this document
- [ ] Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Feature flag system established in `config/features.ts`
- Component structure uses central exports from `components/index.ts`
- Custom hooks available in `hooks/use-features.ts`
- Three-column layout container already created at `components/layout/layout-container.tsx`
- Error boundaries implemented for protection
- Glass morphism and animations already available

### Architecture Context

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- **EnhancedChatPanel** responsibility: Wrap existing chat with suggestion chips and enhanced UI
- Integration points: Extends `/app/chat` without modifying core logic
- Key interfaces:
  - `useChat()` - Existing Vercel AI SDK hook (preserved)
  - `useSuggestions()` - Context-aware suggestion generation
  - `MessageRenderer` - Enhanced message display with typing indicators
- Technology Stack: Preserves existing Vercel AI SDK integration, adds shadcn/ui components

#### Feature Flag Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Feature Flag Architecture]
```typescript
interface FeatureFlags {
  enhancedChat: boolean;  // Story 1.2
}
```
Use the existing `withFeature` HOC pattern for conditional rendering.

#### File Structure
[Source: architecture.md#Source Tree Integration]
```
components/
├── chat/                     # NEW - Chat enhancements
│   ├── enhanced-chat-panel.tsx
│   ├── suggestion-chips.tsx
│   ├── typing-indicator.tsx
│   └── message-list.tsx
```

#### API Integration
[Source: architecture.md#External API Integration]
- OpenRouter API remains unchanged
- Use existing Vercel AI SDK v4 (version 4.3.19) provider
- Structured prompt templates enhance existing completion endpoint usage
- Error handling: Existing retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- Framework: Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- React: 19.1.0
- Vercel AI SDK: 4.3.19 (preserve existing)
- OpenRouter: 0.0.5 (keep configuration)
- UI Components: Use shadcn/ui (already partially installed)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- Animations: Framer Motion 11.x (already installed for Story 1.1c)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md - inferred from project setup]
- Test framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Test file location: Create `__tests__` folders within component directories
- Performance monitoring: Track response times and ensure <2 second threshold
- Feature flag testing: Test both enabled and disabled states
- Integration testing: Verify OpenRouter API calls still function correctly

### Git Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Development Workflow & Git Strategy]

```

### Fix-Forward Philosophy
[Source: architecture.md#Post-Merge Issue Resolution]
- **NEVER REVERT** - Always fix issues and move forward
- All fixes happen on the SAME feature branch during review
- Continue iterating until ALL issues are resolved
- Post-merge issues get hotfixes, not reverts
