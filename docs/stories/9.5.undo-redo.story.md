# Story 9.5: Complete Undo/Redo Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** sitemap builder user,
**I want** to use undo and redo functionality through keyboard shortcuts and UI buttons,
**so that** I can confidently make changes knowing I can easily revert mistakes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Existing UndoManager (from 9.4) integrated with Zustand store for all operations
2. Keyboard shortcuts work: Ctrl+Z/Cmd+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z/Cmd+Shift+Z for redo
3. UI buttons show undo/redo availability (enabled/disabled states)
4. History clears future states when new action performed after undo
5. State preservation includes all node and edge data (via existing UndoManager)
6. Component configurations preserved in history snapshots
7. Parent-child relationships maintained correctly through undo/redo
8. Undo/redo operations complete within 100ms
9. Memory efficient with automatic cleanup beyond 50 states (already in UndoManager)
10. Visual feedback shows what changed during undo/redo
11. History persists during the session but not across page refreshes
12. Integration with save manager prevents saves during undo/redo operations

### Premium Feature Placement Requirements
[Source: docs/epic9-brownfield-prd.md#premium-feature-placement-requirements]

**CRITICAL**: All sitemap code MUST be placed under premium folders:
```
✅ CORRECT Premium Locations:
/lib/premium/components/sitemap/     # UndoManager already here from 9.4
/lib/premium/hooks/                  # New keyboard shortcut hook goes here
/lib/premium/stores/                 # Zustand store already exists from 9.4

❌ FORBIDDEN Locations:
/components/                         # Will leak to open-source
/lib/ (root)                        # Will leak to open-source
/hooks/                             # Will leak to open-source
```

### Existing UndoManager from Story 9.4
[Source: Verified in `/lib/premium/components/sitemap/undo-manager.ts`]

**IMPORTANT**: UndoManager was already implemented in Story 9.4 with the following features:
- Complete class implementation with all required methods
- 50-operation history limit enforced
- State snapshots with deep copying
- canUndo() and canRedo() methods
- onStateChange callback for UI updates
- Singleton instance exported as `undoManager`

**What This Story Needs to Do**:
1. INTEGRATE the existing UndoManager with Zustand store (not implemented yet)
2. ADD keyboard shortcut support (not implemented yet)
3. CREATE UI buttons for undo/redo (not implemented yet)
4. ADD visual feedback for operations (not implemented yet)
5. PREVENT saves during undo/redo (integration needed)

### Integration Pattern with Existing UndoManager
[Source: Story 9.4 implementation analysis]

The existing UndoManager class structure:
```typescript
// Already exists in undo-manager.ts
export class UndoManager {
  pushState(nodes: SitemapNode[], edges: SitemapEdge[]) // Adds to history
  undo(): HistoryState | null                           // Returns previous state
  redo(): HistoryState | null                           // Returns next state
  canUndo(): boolean                                    // UI state check
  canRedo(): boolean                                    // UI state check
  clear()                                               // Reset history
  initialize(nodes, edges)                              // Set initial state
}

// Singleton already exported
export const undoManager = new UndoManager();
```

### Zustand Store Integration Approach
[Source: Story 9.4 store structure]

Extend the existing store to work with the existing UndoManager:
```typescript
// Add to existing sitemap-store.ts
interface SiteStructureState {
  // Existing properties from 9.4
  nodes: Node[]
  edges: Edge[]
  
  // New properties for undo/redo
  canUndo: boolean
  canRedo: boolean
  
  // Existing actions to hook into
  addNode: (parentId: string, data: NodeData) => void    // Hook: capture state after
  updateNode: (nodeId: string, updates: Partial) => void  // Hook: capture state after
  deleteNodes: (nodeIds: string[]) => void                // Hook: capture state after
  moveNode: (nodeId: string, newParentId: string) => void // Hook: capture state after
  
  // New actions for undo/redo
  undo: () => void  // Apply state from undoManager.undo()
  redo: () => void  // Apply state from undoManager.redo()
  
  // Helper to capture current state
  captureState: () => void  // Push current nodes/edges to undoManager
}
```

### Save Prevention During Undo/Redo
[Source: Story 9.4 SaveManager]

The SaveManager from Story 9.4 needs to check if an undo/redo is in progress:
```typescript
// Pattern to prevent saves during undo/redo
let isUndoRedoInProgress = false;

// In undo action
isUndoRedoInProgress = true;
const state = undoManager.undo();
if (state) {
  set({ nodes: state.nodes, edges: state.edges });
}
isUndoRedoInProgress = false;

// In SaveManager integration
if (!isUndoRedoInProgress) {
  saveManager.addOperation(operation);
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcut Implementation
[Source: docs/epic9-brownfield-prd.md#user-interface-integration]

**Cross-platform Support Pattern**:
```typescript
// New file: /lib/premium/hooks/use-undo-redo-shortcuts.ts
export function useUndoRedoShortcuts() {
  const { undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo } = useSitemapStore()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      const isMac = navigator.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf('MAC') >= 0
      const ctrlOrCmd = isMac ? e.metaKey : e.ctrlKey
      
      if (ctrlOrCmd && e.key === 'z' && !e.shiftKey) {
        e.preventDefault()
        if (canUndo) undo()
      } else if (
        (ctrlOrCmd && e.key === 'y') || 
        (ctrlOrCmd && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'z')
      ) {
        e.preventDefault()
        if (canRedo) redo()
      }
    }
    
    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
    return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  }, [undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo])
}
```

### Visual Feedback Requirements
[Source: docs/epic9-brownfield-prd.md#user-experience]

- Toast notifications showing action description
- Highlight affected nodes temporarily (1-2 seconds)
- Smooth transitions between states
- Consider using framer-motion if available

### Testing Approach
[Source: Story 9.4 patterns]

**Focus Areas**:
1. Integration between UndoManager and Zustand store
2. Keyboard shortcuts on Windows, Mac, Linux
3. UI button states sync with canUndo/canRedo
4. Save prevention during undo/redo
5. Performance with 50 operations
6. Memory usage doesn't grow unbounded

### Dependencies and Versions
[Source: Story 9.4, package.json]

```json
{
  "reactflow": "^11.11.4",    // Already installed
  "zustand": "^5.0.7",         // Already installed  
  "immer": "^10.1.1",          // Already installed
  "framer-motion": "^10.x"    // Check if available for animations
}
```

### Lessons from Story 9.4 Implementation

**What Worked Well**:
- UndoManager class is complete and tested
- Singleton pattern allows global access
- 50-state limit already enforced
- Deep copying prevents mutation issues

**What Needs Integration**:
- Connection to Zustand store actions
- UI components for user interaction
- Keyboard shortcut handling
- Visual feedback system
- Save prevention logic

### Performance Considerations

Since UndoManager already exists with deep copying via JSON.parse/stringify:
- Monitor performance with large sitemaps
- Consider using Immer for structural sharing if performance issues
- Profile undo/redo operations to ensure <100ms
- The existing implementation should be sufficient for MVP

## Testing

### Unit Test Requirements
- Location: `/lib/premium/stores/__tests__/sitemap-store.test.ts` (extend existing)
- Test store integration with UndoManager
- Test canUndo/canRedo state updates
- Test save prevention during undo/redo

### Integration Test Requirements  
- Location: `/app/premium/demo/sitemap-builder/__tests__/`
- Test full user flow with keyboard and buttons
- Verify visual feedback works
- Test with 50 operations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Existing UndoManager methods work correctly
- [ ] Zustand store properly captures state after operations
- [ ] Undo/redo buttons enable/disable correctly
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work on Windows
