## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/5-2-website-management-tools (CONTINUING EXISTING BRANCH)
Base Branch: main (NOTE: Repository uses 'main' not 'develop')
PR Target: main

**Note on Branch Strategy**: Epic 5 stories (5.1-5.6) are using a shared feature branch to maintain continuity across the epic implementation and avoid merge conflicts between interdependent stories.

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
2. Pull: `git pull origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
5. PR: Update existing PR with Story 5.6 implementation

### Technical Architecture Context

**Previous Story Insights** [From Stories 5.1-5.5]:
- Complete tool infrastructure implemented at `/lib/ai-tools/`
- All 10 tools operational: 3 website, 4 content type, 3 content item
- Business rules engine at `/lib/ai-tools/business-rules.ts`
- Context provider at `/lib/ai-tools/context/context-provider.ts`
- Tool registry at `/lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts` with `allTools` export
- Chat route at `/app/api/chat/route.ts` fully integrated with tools
- UI enhancements completed in Story 5.5 for tool feedback

**POC Test Patterns** [Source: proof-of-concept/test-ai-tools.js]:
- Uses Vercel AI SDK with OpenRouter for tool calling
- Test structure validates tool execution and results
- Multi-step operations tested with tool chaining
- Success rate: 100% (6/6 tests passed)
- Pattern directly applicable to production tests

**Testing Infrastructure** [Source: docs/testing-infrastructure.md]:
- Jest configuration with parallel execution
- Test categories prioritized by speed
- Coverage thresholds: 80% global minimum
- Multiple test scripts available:
  - `npm test` - Standard test execution
  - `npm run test:performance` - Performance tests
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage reporting
  - `npm run test:e2e` - End-to-end tests with Playwright

**Existing Test Structure** [Source: /tests/ directory]:
- Unit tests in `/tests/` organized by feature
- E2E tests in `/tests/e2e/`
- Epic-specific tests in `/tests/epic-5/` (to be created)
- Test utilities and helpers available

**Error Handling Patterns** [From previous stories]:
```typescript
try {
  // Tool execution with Prisma transaction
  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Perform operations
    return data;
  });
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback handled automatically by Prisma
  return {
    success: false,
    error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
  };
}
```

**Audit Logging Structure** [To be stored in AIContext]:
```typescript
interface ToolExecutionLog {
  toolName: string;
  parameters: object;
  result: object;
  timestamp: Date;
  status: 'success' | 'failure' | 'rollback';
  executionTime: number; // milliseconds
  userId?: string; // For future auth
  sessionId: string;
}
```

**Performance Requirements** [Source: epic-5-prd.md]:
- Tool execution: <2 seconds for standard operations
- Context loading: <500ms for all website sizes
- Streaming response: Immediate feedback to user
- Database transactions: Atomic with automatic rollback
- No degradation of existing chat performance

**Database Considerations** [Source: Prisma/SQLite]:
- SQLite limitations with concurrent writes
- JSON fields for complex data storage
- Transaction isolation levels
- Query optimization with proper indexing
- Connection pooling not applicable (SQLite)

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `/tests/epic-5/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `/tests/epic-5/*-tools.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `/tests/e2e/epic-5-*.spec.ts`
- Performance tests: `/tests/epic-5/performance.test.ts`

**Test Data Fixtures**:
- Create reusable test fixtures in `/tests/epic-5/fixtures/`
- Sample websites with different configurations
- Content types with various field combinations
- Content items with edge case data
- Error-inducing payloads for negative testing

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Supertest for API endpoint testing (if needed)

**Test Patterns**:
```typescript
describe('Tool Name', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup test database state
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Cleanup
  });
  
  it('should execute successfully with valid input', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Error case testing
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage globally
- 100% coverage for critical paths (tool execution, rollback)
- All error paths must be tested
- Performance benchmarks must be documented
- Tool-specific coverage targets:
  - Website tools: 85% coverage
  - Content type tools: 85% coverage  
  - Content item tools: 85% coverage
  - Context provider: 90% coverage
  - Audit logger: 90% coverage
