## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/5-2-website-management-tools (CONTINUING EXISTING BRANCH)
Base Branch: main (NOTE: Repository uses 'main' not 'develop')
PR Target: main

**Note on Branch Strategy**: Epic 5 stories (5.1-5.6) are using a shared feature branch to maintain continuity across the epic implementation and avoid merge conflicts between interdependent stories.

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
2. Pull: `git pull origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push origin feature/5-2-website-management-tools`
5. PR: Update existing PR with Story 5.6 implementation

### Technical Architecture Context

**Previous Story Insights** [From Stories 5.1-5.5]:
- Complete tool infrastructure implemented at `/lib/ai-tools/`
- All 10 tools operational: 3 website, 4 content type, 3 content item
- Business rules engine at `/lib/ai-tools/business-rules.ts`
- Context provider at `/lib/ai-tools/context/context-provider.ts`
- Tool registry at `/lib/ai-tools/tools/index.ts` with `allTools` export
- Chat route at `/app/api/chat/route.ts` fully integrated with tools
- UI enhancements completed in Story 5.5 for tool feedback

**POC Test Patterns** [Source: proof-of-concept/test-ai-tools.js]:
- Uses Vercel AI SDK with OpenRouter for tool calling
- Test structure validates tool execution and results
- Multi-step operations tested with tool chaining
- Success rate: 100% (6/6 tests passed)
- Pattern directly applicable to production tests

**Testing Infrastructure** [Source: docs/testing-infrastructure.md]:
- Jest configuration with parallel execution
- Test categories prioritized by speed
- Coverage thresholds: 80% global minimum
- Multiple test scripts available:
  - `npm test` - Standard test execution
  - `npm run test:performance` - Performance tests
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage reporting
  - `npm run test:e2e` - End-to-end tests with Playwright

**Existing Test Structure** [Source: /tests/ directory]:
- Unit tests in `/tests/` organized by feature
- E2E tests in `/tests/e2e/`
- Epic-specific tests in `/tests/epic-5/` (to be created)
- Test utilities and helpers available

**Error Handling Patterns** [From previous stories]:
```typescript
try {
  // Tool execution with Prisma transaction
  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Perform operations
    return data;
  });
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback handled automatically by Prisma
  return {
    success: false,
    error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
  };
}
```

**Audit Logging Structure** [To be stored in AIContext]:
```typescript
interface ToolExecutionLog {
  toolName: string;
  parameters: object;
  result: object;
  timestamp: Date;
  status: 'success' | 'failure' | 'rollback';
  executionTime: number; // milliseconds
  userId?: string; // For future auth
  sessionId: string;
}
```

**Performance Requirements** [Source: epic-5-prd.md]:
- Tool execution: <2 seconds for standard operations
- Context loading: <500ms for all website sizes
- Streaming response: Immediate feedback to user
- Database transactions: Atomic with automatic rollback
- No degradation of existing chat performance

**Database Considerations** [Source: Prisma/SQLite]:
- SQLite limitations with concurrent writes
- JSON fields for complex data storage
- Transaction isolation levels
- Query optimization with proper indexing
- Connection pooling not applicable (SQLite)

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `/tests/epic-5/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `/tests/epic-5/*-tools.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `/tests/e2e/epic-5-*.spec.ts`
- Performance tests: `/tests/epic-5/performance.test.ts`

**Test Data Fixtures**:
- Create reusable test fixtures in `/tests/epic-5/fixtures/`
- Sample websites with different configurations
- Content types with various field combinations
- Content items with edge case data
- Error-inducing payloads for negative testing

**Testing Frameworks**:
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Supertest for API endpoint testing (if needed)

**Test Patterns**:
```typescript
describe('Tool Name', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup test database state
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    // Cleanup
  });
  
  it('should execute successfully with valid input', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Error case testing
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage globally
- 100% coverage for critical paths (tool execution, rollback)
- All error paths must be tested
- Performance benchmarks must be documented
- Tool-specific coverage targets:
  - Website tools: 85% coverage
  - Content type tools: 85% coverage  
  - Content item tools: 85% coverage
  - Context provider: 90% coverage
  - Audit logger: 90% coverage

## QA Results

### Test Execution Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-14
**QA Engineer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Test Coverage:** Comprehensive review of Story 5.6 and Epic 5 requirements

### Critical Issues Found 🔴

1. **Jest Worker Process Failures**
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Impact:** Test suite unable to complete successfully
   - **Evidence:** Multiple test suites failing with "Jest worker encountered 4 child process exceptions"
   - **Root Cause:** Prisma client generation conflicts when dev server is running
   - **Files Affected:** All Epic 5 test files in `/tests/epic-5/`

2. **AI Chat Interface Runtime Error**
   - **Severity:** Critical  
   - **Impact:** AI chat functionality completely broken
   - **Evidence:** 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/chat` endpoint
   - **Symptoms:** "Recovering conversation..." stuck state, Jest worker errors in browser
   - **User Experience:** Cannot use AI tools for content management

3. **Content Type API Validation Failures**
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Impact:** Content type creation failing due to schema validation
   - **Evidence:** Multiple validation errors in E2E tests for required fields
   - **Missing Fields:** pluralName, icon, field IDs, labels, order values

### Test Results Overview

| Test Category | Status | Pass Rate | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ❌ FAILED | 493/694 (71%) | 188 failures, Prisma lock issues |
| Integration Tests (Epic 5) | ❌ FAILED | 5/116 (4%) | 111 failures, API validation errors |
| E2E Tests | ⚠️ TIMEOUT | N/A | Exceeded 2-minute timeout |
| Manual Testing | ❌ FAILED | 0% | Critical runtime errors prevent testing |

### Epic 5 Goals Achievement Assessment

| Goal | Target | Actual | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tool Execution Capability | 10 tools | 0 functional | ❌ Not Met |
| Content Setup Time | 3 minutes | Cannot test | ❌ Blocked |
| Tool Success Rate | 95% | 0% | ❌ Not Met |
| Performance (<2s execution) | <2 seconds | Cannot measure | ❌ Blocked |
| Context Loading | <500ms | Cannot measure | ❌ Blocked |

### Acceptance Criteria Status (Story 5.6)

1. ❌ **POC Test Scenarios:** 0/6 passing (database connection issues)
2. ❌ **Integration Tests:** Incomplete coverage, validation failures
3. ❌ **Error Recovery:** Cannot test due to runtime errors
4. ❌ **Audit Logging:** Implementation exists but untestable
5. ❌ **Performance Benchmarks:** Cannot verify due to failures

### Code Quality Observations

**Positive Findings:**
- Comprehensive test file structure created
- Audit logger implementation appears complete
- Error handling patterns properly implemented
- TypeScript types well-defined

**Areas of Concern:**
- Missing required field validations in API layer
- Prisma client generation conflicts
- No error boundaries for runtime failures
- Insufficient integration between Stories 5.1-5.5

### Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be incomplete integration between Epic 5 stories:
1. Story 5.5 chat enhancement not properly integrated with tool infrastructure
2. Missing field validation in content type tools
3. Database transaction handling causing worker process failures
4. Environment configuration issues with OpenRouter API

### Recommendations for Resolution

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Fix Prisma client generation conflicts
2. Add missing field validations to content type schemas
3. Implement proper error boundaries in chat interface
4. Fix OpenRouter API integration in chat route

**Code Fixes Needed:**
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Fix tool integration
- `/lib/ai-tools/tools/content-type-tools.ts` - Add field validations
- `/tests/setup/test-environment.ts` - Fix Prisma conflicts
- Add `.env.test` configuration for API keys

### Testing Blockers

Cannot proceed with comprehensive testing until:
1. Runtime errors in AI chat are resolved
2. Jest worker process issues fixed
3. Content type validation errors corrected
4. API endpoint errors (500s) resolved

### QA Verdict: ❌ FAILED - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Overall Score:** 2/10
- Story 5.6 implementation incomplete
- Epic 5 goals not achieved
- Critical functionality broken
- Significant integration issues between stories

**Next Steps:**
1. Development team must fix critical issues
2. Re-run full test suite after fixes
3. Perform integration testing across all Epic 5 stories
4. Validate AI tool execution manually
5. Performance testing only after functional issues resolved

### Additional Notes

The implementation shows good architectural patterns and comprehensive test coverage planning, but execution has critical gaps. The main issue is that Stories 5.1-5.5 were not properly integrated, leaving Story 5.6 unable to validate the complete Epic 5 functionality. A holistic integration effort is needed before this can pass QA.
