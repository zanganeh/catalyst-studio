## Dev Notes

### Gitflow Branch Strategy
**Branch Structure:**
- Feature branch: `feature/story-1.9-source-code-view`
- Base branch: `develop` (if exists) or `main`
- Each task should be committed separately with clear messages
- Create PR when story is complete

**Task 0: Setup Feature Branch**
- [ ] Create feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/story-1.9-source-code-view`
- [ ] Verify branch is up to date with main
- [ ] Setup commit message convention: `feat(source-view): [task description]`
- [ ] Plan atomic commits for each subtask completion

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.7.story.md - Completion Notes]
- Story 1.7 successfully implemented sophisticated state management patterns
- Used composition pattern to avoid modifying core logic
- Performance monitoring integrated with threshold warnings
- These patterns should be referenced for implementing code view state

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture - Line 331]
The SourceCodeView component is part of the MainContent area in the component hierarchy:
```
MainContent
  └── SourceCodeView
```
It should be implemented as an isolated component that doesn't affect existing chat or preview functionality.

### File Locations
[Source: architecture.md#Source Tree Integration - Lines 416-467]
Based on the project structure, new files should be created at:
- `components/development/` - Source code view components
  - `source-code-view.tsx` - Main container component
  - `file-tree.tsx` - File browser component
  - `editor-tabs.tsx` - Tab navigation component
  - `code-editor.tsx` - Editor wrapper component
- `lib/export/` - Export functionality
  - `code-export-service.ts` - Export service logic
- `app/(dashboard)/development/page.tsx` - Already exists, needs updating

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment - Lines 80-100]
- **Code Editor**: @monaco-editor/react (primary choice - VS Code familiarity)
  - Fallback: CodeMirror if bundle size exceeds 500KB limit
  - Implementation: Use Next.js dynamic imports to handle SSR
- **UI Components**: Use shadcn/ui components (already configured)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Catalyst X theme variables
- **State Management**: Start with React Context, add Zustand if complexity demands
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions (if needed)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Budget - Lines 492-500]
- Bundle Size: Keep under 500KB (consider code splitting for editor)
- Load Time: <1.5s first paint
- Memory Usage: <100MB even with large files
- Monitor performance using PerformanceObserver pattern

### UI Consistency Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#UI Consistency Requirements - Lines 135-141]
- Use established Catalyst X design tokens
- Maintain 45-degree geometric patterns in UI elements
- Glass morphism aesthetic with backdrop-filter
- Color palette: #FF5500 (orange), #212121 (dark), #0077CC (blue), #00AA55 (green)
- Use Inter font family with weight variations (200, 400, 500, 700)
- Smooth animations with cubic-bezier transitions

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy - Lines 870-911]
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
  - Location: Colocated with components (`*.test.tsx`)
  - Coverage target: 80% for new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test editor integration with file system
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests in `tests/features/source-code-view.spec.ts`
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure <2 second load time

### Integration Verification Requirements
[Source: PRD#Story 1.9 - Lines 402-405]
- IV1: Code view matches mockup's editor design
- IV2: Syntax highlighting works for all supported languages
- IV3: Large files display without performance issues

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Security Integration - Lines 938-950]
- Sanitize file names before display
- Validate file content before rendering
- Prevent XSS through code content
- No execution of displayed code
- Limit file size for performance/security

## Refactoring Suggestions (Non-blocking)

### 1. Consider bundling JSZip
Currently loads from CDN. Could bundle it to reduce external dependencies:
```typescript
// Instead of CDN loading, use:
npm install jszip
import JSZip from 'jszip';
```

### 2. Enhanced file type support
Could add more file type icons and syntax highlighting:
```typescript
// Add support for: .vue, .svelte, .go, .rs, .py, etc.
```

### 3. Virtual scrolling for large file trees
For projects with thousands of files, consider react-window:
```typescript
// Use FixedSizeTree from react-window for performance
```
