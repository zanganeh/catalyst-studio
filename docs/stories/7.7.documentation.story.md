## Status
Draft

## Estimation
2 days

## Story
**As a** team member,  
**I want** comprehensive documentation and AI training data,  
**so that** the system can be maintained and AI can effectively use it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Provider development guide created with step-by-step instructions
2. AI system prompts finalized in `prompts/universal-types/` directory
3. Transformation examples catalog with 10+ real-world scenarios
4. API documentation updated with provider patterns
5. CLAUDE.md updated with:
   - Universal type generation patterns
   - Provider selection commands
   - Transformation validation rules
   - AI content type generation guidelines
   - Category field requirements ('page' vs 'component')
6. .env.example with all configuration variables documented
7. README updated with Epic 7 features and usage

## Definition of Done

## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/epic7-7-documentation
Base Branch: main
PR Target: main

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/epic7-7-documentation`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/epic7-7-documentation`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 7 Story 7.7: Documentation & AI Training Data"

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 7.6 Dev Agent Record - Expected]

Story 7.6 will have completed the application layer integration, replacing all direct Optimizely calls with provider interface usage. The mock provider implementation from 7.6 will serve as a reference for the provider development guide.

[Source: Story 7.4 Dev Agent Record]

Story 7.4 successfully implemented:
- Dynamic type loading system in `lib/services/universal-types/`
- Universal type context builder with session awareness
- Integration tests showing usage patterns
- Platform capability matrix for transformations

These implementations provide concrete examples for documentation.

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md]

#### Documentation Structure
The documentation should follow this organization:
```
docs/
├── provider-development-guide.md    # How to create new providers
├── universal-types-guide.md         # Universal type system usage
├── transformation-guide.md          # Type transformation examples
└── ai-integration-guide.md          # AI prompt usage

prompts/universal-types/
├── generation-rules.md               # Core AI generation rules
├── type-examples.json                # Example content types
├── validation-rules.md               # Validation criteria
├── platform-mappings.json            # Platform capabilities
└── templates/                        # Template structures
    ├── content-type-generation.md
    └── duplication-check.md
```

#### Key Documentation Topics
[Source: docs/epic7-prd.md#ai-adaptation-mechanism]

1. **Universal Type Generation Rules:**
   - Three-layer type system usage
   - Content type structure requirements
   - Field definition rules
   - Platform assumption avoidance
   - Validation requirements

2. **Category Classification:**
   - 'page': Routable content with URLs
   - 'component': Reusable, non-routable blocks
   - Validation rules for each category
   - Composition patterns

3. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - 0-100% scoring system
   - >70% for automatic application
   - 50-70% requires manual review
   - <50% rejection threshold

4. **Platform Mappings:**
   - Optimizely field type mappings
   - Contentful field type mappings (future)
   - Strapi field type mappings (future)
   - Fallback strategies for each

#### AI Prompt Requirements
[Source: docs/epic7-prd.md#ai-generation-guidelines]

The AI prompts must enforce:
- Default to three-layer type system
- Content type must include 'type' field ('page' or 'component')
- PascalCase for type names
- camelCase for field names
- Required validation rules
- Fallback strategies for complex types

#### CLAUDE.md Updates
[Source: Current CLAUDE.md]

The existing CLAUDE.md already includes:
- Universal Type Generation System overview
- Key features and commands
- Usage examples
- Architecture details
- Troubleshooting guide

Updates should enhance these sections with:
- Finalized prompt templates
- More transformation examples
- Provider selection guidance
- Category field emphasis

### Implementation Files Reference
[Source: docs/architecture/type-system-complete.md]

Key implementation files to reference in documentation:
- `lib/providers/universal/type-system.ts` - Main facade
- `lib/providers/universal/interfaces/type-provider.ts` - Provider interface
- `lib/providers/universal/registry/type-system-registry.ts` - Registry pattern
- `lib/providers/optimizely/` - Example provider implementation
- `lib/services/universal-types/` - Dynamic type loading

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/epic7-architecture.md#testing-strategy]

Documentation should include testing examples:
- Unit test patterns for providers
- Integration test setup
- Mock provider usage
- Test data generation
- Coverage requirements (90% for providers)

### Important Documentation Requirements

1. **Provider Development Guide Must Include:**
   - Complete ICMSProvider interface documentation
   - Step-by-step implementation walkthrough
   - Testing requirements and examples
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Performance optimization tips

2. **AI Prompts Must Enforce:**
   - Category field requirement ('page' vs 'component')
   - Three-layer type system usage
   - Validation before application
   - Confidence scoring thresholds
   - Platform-agnostic generation

3. **Examples Must Cover:**
   - Simple content types (BlogPost, ProductPage)
   - Complex nested structures
   - Component composition patterns
   - Failed transformation scenarios
   - Recovery strategies

4. **Environment Documentation Must Include:**
   - All Epic 7 related variables
   - Provider selection configuration
   - Feature flag settings
   - Mock mode configuration
   - Security best practices
