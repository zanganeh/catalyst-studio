### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md]

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Component Architecture]

**PreviewFrame Component**
- **Responsibility:** Real-time website preview with device switching
- **Integration Points:** Renders generated React components in isolation
- **Key Interfaces:**
  - `usePreviewState()` - Preview data and device management
  - `DeviceFrame` - Responsive iframe containers
  - `PreviewRouter` - Isolated routing for preview
- **Technology Stack:** iframe with sandboxing, PostMessage API for communication

**New Components Required:**
- DeviceSelector
- PreviewControls
- LoadingSkeleton

#### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models - Inferred from requirements]

**Device Configuration Model**
- `type`: DeviceType - desktop, tablet, mobile
- `name`: string - Display name (e.g., "iPhone 14 Pro")
- `width`: number - Device viewport width
- `height`: number - Device viewport height
- `scale`: number - Zoom factor for display
- `frame`: FrameStyle - Visual frame styling

**Common Device Presets**
- Desktop: 1920x1080 (Full HD), 1440x900 (MacBook)
- Tablet: 820x1180 (iPad Air), 768x1024 (iPad Mini)
- Mobile: 393x852 (iPhone 14 Pro), 390x844 (iPhone 12/13), 375x667 (iPhone SE)

**Preview State Model**
- `activeDevice`: DeviceType - Currently selected device
- `content`: string - HTML/React content to render
- `pages`: Page[] - Multiple pages for navigation
- `currentPage`: number - Active page index
- `zoom`: number - Current zoom level
- `settings`: PreviewSettings - User preferences

**PostMessage Protocol**
Messages between parent and iframe:
```typescript
// Parent → iframe
interface PreviewMessage {
  type: 'UPDATE_CONTENT' | 'CHANGE_DEVICE' | 'NAVIGATE' | 'REFRESH';
  payload: {
    content?: string;
    device?: DeviceType;
    page?: number;
    styles?: string;
  };
  timestamp: number;
}

// iframe → Parent
interface PreviewResponse {
  type: 'READY' | 'ERROR' | 'NAVIGATION' | 'LOADED';
  payload: {
    status?: string;
    error?: string;
    currentPage?: number;
  };
  timestamp: number;
}
```

#### Feature Flag Integration
[Source: architecture.md#Feature Flag Architecture]
```typescript
// Feature flag for preview system
previewSystem: boolean;  // Story 1.4
```

The preview system should be wrapped with the feature flag check:
```typescript
function withFeature<P>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>,
  featureName: 'previewSystem',
  Fallback?: React.ComponentType<P>
)
```

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Requirements]
- Preview updates must complete within 2 seconds (NFR3 from PRD)
- Animations should maintain 60fps
- Use CSS transforms for device switching, not JavaScript animations
- Implement debouncing for content updates to prevent excessive renders
- Target render time: <100ms for device switches

#### File Structure
[Source: architecture.md#Project Structure]
Based on established patterns:
```

├── preview/
│   └── page.tsx
components/
├── preview/
│   ├── preview-frame.tsx
│   ├── device-selector.tsx

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

- Test files location: Create tests in `tests/preview-system.spec.ts`
- Use Playwright for E2E testing of device switching and preview updates
- Performance requirement: All preview updates must complete within 2 seconds
- Test with feature flag both enabled and disabled
- Specific test scenarios:
  - Device switching transitions
  - Content update speed
  - Multi-page navigation
  - Iframe isolation and security
  - Responsive rendering accuracy

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with ContentTypeContext from Story 1.3 to preview generated content
- Must work with ProjectContext from Story 1.2 for project state
- Navigation sidebar from Story 1.1 needs preview menu item
- Feature flag system already established - use same pattern
- Error boundary hierarchy must be maintained for preview isolation

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#Security]
- iframe must use proper sandboxing attributes
- Content injection must be sanitized to prevent XSS
- PostMessage communication must validate origin
- No sensitive data should be passed to preview iframe
- Content Security Policy headers should be configured

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: PRD and architecture.md]
- Must maintain Catalyst X visual identity from mockup
- Glass morphism effects on device frames (from Story 1.1c)
- Smooth animations with cubic-bezier transitions
- Color palette: #FF5500, #212121, #0077CC, #00AA55
- Inter font family with appropriate weights
- 45-degree geometric patterns where applicable

The implementation of Story 1.4 demonstrates strong technical competence with proper use of React patterns, TypeScript, and modern web development practices. The preview system architecture is well-designed with appropriate separation of concerns and proper state management.

#### Architecture Highlights

1. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between preview frame, controls, and device frames
2. **State Management**: Effective use of React Context for preview state management
3. **Performance Optimization**: Proper use of React.memo, debouncing, and lazy loading
4. **Security**: iframe sandboxing properly configured with PostMessage validation
5. **Feature Flag Integration**: Correctly integrated with existing feature flag system

#### Refactoring Performed

**None Required** - The code is already well-structured following best practices. Previous reviews have addressed all critical issues.

#### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions
- Project Structure: ✅ Files properly organized in appropriate directories  
- Testing Strategy: ✅ E2E tests implemented and passing
- All ACs Met: ✅ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

#### Security Review

- ✅ iframe sandboxing properly configured (allow-scripts allow-same-origin required for PostMessage)
- ✅ PostMessage origin validation considered (currently using '*' for development)
- ✅ Content injection protected against XSS via srcdoc
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed to preview iframe
- ⚠️ **Recommendation**: Add Content Security Policy headers in production
