## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/epic6-dashboard-integration
Base Branch: main
PR Target: main

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/epic6-dashboard-integration`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/epic6-dashboard-integration`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 6 Story 9: Connect to Existing Dashboard"

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 6.8 Dev Agent Record]
- Validation layer implemented with Zod in `/lib/sync/validation/`
- ValidationErrorReporter provides structured error formats with severity levels
- SyncEngine has pre-sync validation checkpoint that generates validation results
- Validation bypass requires explicit user confirmation and audit logging

### Existing UI Components
[Source: Project file structure]
The existing CMS Deployment UI components to integrate with:
- `/components/deployment/deployment-wizard.tsx` - 4-step wizard for deployment
- `/components/deployment/deployment-progress.tsx` - Real-time progress display
- `/components/deployment/deployment-history.tsx` - Historical deployment records
- `/components/deployment/deployment-results.tsx` - Deployment outcome display
- `/components/ui/*` - Shared UI components (Button, Card, Alert, etc.)

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/epic6-architecture.md#Existing Technology Stack]
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18.x, TypeScript
- Styling: TailwindCSS 3.x
- State Management: React hooks and context
- API: Next.js API routes
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library

### Sync Engine Integration Points
[Source: docs/epic6-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- SyncEngine location: `/lib/sync/engine/SyncEngine.ts`
- StateManager: `/lib/sync/state/SyncStateManager.ts`
- ConflictDetector: `/lib/sync/conflict/ConflictDetector.ts`
- VersionHistoryManager: `/lib/sync/versioning/VersionHistoryManager.ts`
- SyncAnalytics: `/lib/sync/tracking/SyncAnalytics.ts`

### API Route Patterns
[Source: Project structure analysis]
- API routes located in `/app/api/`
- Follow RESTful patterns
- Return JSON responses
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Example pattern from existing routes:
  - GET `/api/content-types` - List resources
  - GET `/api/content-types/[id]` - Get single resource
  - POST `/api/content-types` - Create resource
  - PUT `/api/content-types/[id]` - Update resource

### API Error Codes
Standard HTTP status codes with custom error messages:
- 200: Success with data
- 201: Created successfully
- 400: Bad Request - "Invalid sync configuration"
- 401: Unauthorized - "Authentication required for sync operations"
- 403: Forbidden - "Insufficient permissions for sync management"
- 404: Not Found - "Sync record not found"
- 409: Conflict - "Sync conflict detected, manual resolution required"
- 500: Internal Server Error - "Sync engine error, check logs"

### Real-time Update Considerations
[Source: docs/epic6-architecture.md#UI Integration]
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates (Next.js compatible, simpler than WebSocket)
- Maintain consistency with existing UI update patterns
- Ensure status updates are throttled to prevent UI flooding (max 1 update per 100ms)
- Include progress percentage and estimated time remaining

### Conflict Resolution UI Requirements
[Source: docs/epic6-requirements.md & ConflictManager implementation]
- Display three-way diff: base version, source changes, target changes
- Allow manual editing of resolved content
- Provide automatic resolution strategies
- Show conflict impact analysis
- Maintain audit trail of resolution decisions

### Analytics Data Points
[Source: SyncAnalytics implementation from previous stories]
Key metrics to display:
- Total syncs performed
- Success/failure rates
- Average sync duration
- Conflicts per sync
- Validation errors per sync
- Most frequently synced content types
- Sync volume over time

### Testing Standards
[Source: Project patterns and existing test files]
- Test files co-located with components in `__tests__` folders
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Mock API calls and external services
- Test both success and error paths
- Aim for >80% coverage
- Use descriptive test names: `it('should...')`

### Performance Considerations
- Dashboard should load within 2 seconds
- Real-time updates should have <100ms latency
- Implement pagination for version history (show 20 items initially)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

### Security Considerations
- All sync operations require authentication
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Sanitize user input in conflict resolution
- Audit log all sync operations
- Validate permissions before displaying sensitive sync data

### Mock Data Structures for Testing
```typescript
// Mock sync status response
{
  status: 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'pending',
  progress: 65, // percentage
  currentStep: 'validating',
  totalSteps: 5,
  startedAt: '2025-01-18T10:00:00Z',
  estimatedCompletion: '2025-01-18T10:05:00Z',
  errors: []
}

// Mock version history item
{
  id: 'version-123',
  contentTypeId: 'ct-456',
  version: '2.1.0',
  hash: 'abc123def456',
  parentHash: 'xyz789uvw012',
  createdAt: '2025-01-18T09:00:00Z',
  changeSource: 'UI',
  author: 'user@example.com',
  changes: { added: 2, modified: 3, removed: 1 }
}

// Mock conflict data
{
  id: 'conflict-789',
  contentTypeId: 'ct-456',
  baseVersion: '2.0.0',
  sourceChanges: { /* content type data */ },
  targetChanges: { /* content type data */ },
  conflictType: 'field_type_mismatch',
  severity: 'high',
  resolutionStrategy: 'manual'
}
```
