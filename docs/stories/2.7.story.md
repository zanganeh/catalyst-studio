## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Completions
[Source: Stories 2.1-2.6 Completion Notes]
- Story 2.1: Comprehensive audit completed, found no server/DB involvement
- Story 2.2: Core infrastructure removed, stub files created
- Story 2.3: All UI components cleaned, feature flags removed
- Story 2.4: Verified no server-side feature flags exist

### Files Removed in Previous Stories
[Source: Stories 2.2-2.6]

**Core Infrastructure (Story 2.2):**
- `/config/features.ts`
- `/contexts/feature-flag-context.tsx`
- `/hooks/use-features.ts`
- `/app/feature-flags/page.tsx`

**Stub Files (Story 2.6):**

### Verification Commands
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]

```bash
# Search for any remaining references
grep -r "featureFlag\|feature-flag\|feature_flag" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.next

# Check for specific function names
grep -r "isFeatureEnabled\|enableFeature\|disableFeature" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Check for hook usage
grep -r "useFeature\|useFeatures\|useFeatureToggle" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Build and quality checks
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

### localStorage Cleanup Pattern
[Source: Best practices for localStorage migration]

```javascript
// One-time cleanup code (can be added to app initialization)
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.localStorage) {
  // Remove old feature flags data
  localStorage.removeItem('featureFlags');
  
  // Optional: Set a flag to indicate migration completed
  localStorage.setItem('featureFlagsMigrated', 'true');
}
```

### Documentation Locations
[Source: Project structure]

**Documentation to Update:**
- `/docs/architecture.md` - Main architecture document
- `/docs/prd.md` - Product requirements document
- `/docs/README.md` - Project documentation (if exists)
- `/README.md` - Root readme (if contains feature flag info)

**New Documentation to Create:**
- `/docs/epic2-completion.md` - Epic 2 completion summary
- `/docs/feature-flag-migration.md` - User migration guide
- `/docs/epic2-audit-final.md` - Final audit report

### Testing Checklist
[Source: QA Standards]

**All Epic 1 Features to Verify:**
1. Enhanced Chat Panel - Structured prompts, advanced features
2. Chat Persistence - Save/load functionality
3. Content Builder - Fully accessible, all tools available
4. Preview System - Multi-device preview working
5. Source Code View - Code editor and syntax highlighting
6. Glass Morphism - Visual effects applying
7. Navigation - All items visible, no hidden sections
8. Analytics Display - If implemented
9. Three Column Layout - If implemented

### Important Notes
1. **User Impact:** Minimal - all features already visible in Epic 1
2. **Breaking Changes:** None expected
3. **Performance:** Should improve with removed conditionals
4. **Rollback:** Not needed - features already live
5. **Documentation:** Critical for future maintenance

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All Epic 1 features function without any feature flag code
- **IV2**: Application builds, tests, and deploys successfully
- **IV3**: Documentation accurately reflects the new architecture
