# Story 8.4: Site Structure Service Layer

## Status
Draft

## Story Metadata
- **Epic**: Epic 8 - AI-Powered Site Structure Generation
- **Story ID**: 8.4
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Dependencies**: Story 8.1 (Database Schema), Story 8.2 (Slug Management), Story 8.3 (Page Orchestration API)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (Core service layer for tree operations)
- **Estimated Duration**: 2 days

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a comprehensive Site Structure Service Layer that handles all tree operations and path management,
**So that** I can perform complex hierarchical operations like tree traversal, path recalculation, and bulk operations efficiently.

## Background & Context

Following the Page Orchestration API implementation (8.3), we need to implement the Site Structure Service Layer that provides all the tree manipulation operations, path management utilities, and validation logic required for managing hierarchical site structures. This service will be used by the Page Orchestrator and other components that need to work with the site hierarchy.

### Key Architectural Requirements
The Site Structure Service handles operations at the structure level, separate from content management. It provides:
- Tree traversal operations (ancestors, descendants, siblings)
- Path management and recalculation
- Node moving with circular reference prevention
- Bulk operations for efficiency
- Tree validation and integrity checks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] SiteStructureService class implemented with all core methods
2. [ ] Tree traversal methods return correct hierarchical data
3. [ ] Path recalculation cascades properly to all descendants
4. [ ] Move operations prevent circular references
5. [ ] Bulk operations complete in < 1 second for 100 nodes
6. [ ] Tree integrity validation identifies orphaned nodes
7. [ ] Get tree operation returns complete hierarchy with proper nesting
8. [ ] Breadcrumb generation returns accurate ancestor chain
9. [ ] Position reordering maintains sequential order
10. [ ] All operations use proper database transactions
11. [ ] Unit tests with 85%+ coverage for service methods
12. [ ] Integration tests validating tree operations
13. [ ] TypeScript interfaces properly exported

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.3 (Page Orchestration API):
- PageOrchestrator is in `lib/services/site-structure/page-orchestrator.ts`
- Uses Prisma transactions with `$transaction` for atomicity
- Slug management utilities already available in `slug-manager.ts`
- Error classes defined in `lib/services/site-structure/errors.ts`
- Type definitions in `lib/types/page-orchestrator.types.ts`

### Architecture Context

#### Service Layer Architecture
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-architecture.md#service-layer-architecture]
The SiteStructureService implements the ISiteStructureService interface:
```typescript
interface ISiteStructureService {
  generateFromRequirements(requirements: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  create(node: CreateNodeDto): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  update(id: string, updates: UpdateNodeDto): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  move(nodeId: string, newParentId: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  resolveUrl(path: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  getTree(websiteId: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
}
```

#### Repository Pattern
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-architecture.md#repository-pattern]
```typescript
interface ISiteStructureRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  findByPath(path: string): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  findChildren(parentId: string): Promise<SiteStructure[]>;
  findAncestors(nodeId: string): Promise<SiteStructure[]>;
  save(node: SiteStructure): Promise<SiteStructure>;
  updatePaths(nodeId: string): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Path Management Algorithm
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-architecture.md#path-management, adapted in Story 8.3]
- Full paths are constructed as: `${parentPath}/${slug}`
- Root nodes have paths like: `/slug`
- Path depth is calculated and stored in `pathDepth` field (NOT 'depth')
- **Note:** Materialized path concept from architecture was NOT implemented - parent chain traversal is done by walking up parentId references instead

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-prd.md#performance]
- URL resolution: < 10ms using indexed fullPath
- Bulk operations: < 1 second for 100 nodes
- Tree rendering: < 100ms for 500 nodes
- Use database indexes on: fullPath, parentId, websiteId, pathDepth

#### Database Models
[Source: Story 8.1 implementation, adapted in Story 8.3]
The site_structure table actual fields (as implemented):
- id (UUID primary key)
- websiteId (foreign key to websites)
- contentItemId (foreign key to content_items)
- parentId (self-referential foreign key)
- slug (unique per parent)
- fullPath (indexed for O(1) lookups)
- pathDepth (NOT 'depth' - for level queries)
- position (ordering among siblings)
- weight (currently just set to 0)

**IMPORTANT:** The original architecture mentioned `materializedPath` for storing ancestor IDs, but this was NOT implemented. The system uses `fullPath` for all path operations and parent chain traversal instead.

#### Circular Reference Prevention
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-architecture.md#move-operations]
Before moving a node, check if the target parent is a descendant of the node being moved:
```typescript
async wouldCreateCycle(nodeId: string, newParentId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Get all descendants of nodeId
  // Check if newParentId is in that list
  // Return true if cycle would be created
}
```

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: `feature/8-4-site-structure-service`
Base Branch: main
PR Target: main

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/8-4-site-structure-service`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/8-4-site-structure-service`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 8 Story 8.4: Site Structure Service Layer"

### Testing Standards
[Source: Project conventions]
- Test files location: `__tests__` folder in same directory as source
- Testing framework: Jest with TypeScript
- Coverage requirement: 85%+ for services
- Use test database for integration tests
- Mock Prisma for unit tests using jest.mock()
- Performance tests should validate < 1 second for 100 nodes

### Implementation Example
[Source: docs/epic8-brownfield-architecture.md#site-structure-service]
```typescript
export class SiteStructureService implements ISiteStructureService {
  constructor(
    private readonly repository: ISiteStructureRepository,
    private readonly pathManager: IPathManager,
    private readonly validator: IStructureValidator,
    private readonly eventBus: IEventBus
  ) {}

  async move(nodeId: string, newParentId: string): Promise<SiteStructure> {
    // Prevent circular references
    if (await this.validator.wouldCreateCycle(nodeId, newParentId)) {
      throw new CircularReferenceError();
    }
    
    // Update in transaction
    return await this.repository.transaction(async (trx) => {
      // Update parent and paths
      // Cascade to children
      return updated;
    });
  }
}
```

### Tree Operation Complexity
- getTree: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- getAncestors: O(depth) using materialized path
- getDescendants: O(subtree size)
- move: O(descendants) for path updates
- resolveUrl: O(1) with indexed fullPath

### Error Handling
- Use HTTP 409 for circular reference errors
- Use HTTP 404 for non-existent nodes
- Use HTTP 400 for validation errors
- Always include detailed error messages
- Log errors with context for debugging
