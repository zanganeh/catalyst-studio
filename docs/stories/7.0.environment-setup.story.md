## Dev Notes

### GitFlow Workflow
Branch Name: feature/epic7-environment-setup
Base Branch: main
PR Target: main

Git Commands:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/epic7-environment-setup`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/epic7-environment-setup`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 7 Story 7.0: Environment Setup & Credential Management"

### Project Structure Context
**Current CMS Integration Location**: 
- Existing Optimizely integration found in `lib/sync/adapters/optimizely-api-client.ts` [Source: project scan]
- Test files in `lib/sync/adapters/__tests__/` [Source: project scan]
- This story focuses on documentation and setup, not modifying existing code

**New Directory Structure for Epic 7**:
According to the architecture document, the provider pattern will eventually use:
```
lib/providers/                    # Future location for provider architecture
  optimizely/                      # Optimizely provider module
  common/                          # Shared interfaces
```
[Source: epic7-architecture.md#New File Organization]

**Environment Variables Required** (from PRD):
```bash
# CMS Provider Configuration
PROVIDER_TYPE=optimizely # Options: optimizely, contentful, strapi, mock

# Optimizely Configuration  
OPTIMIZELY_API_KEY=
OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_ID=
OPTIMIZELY_API_URL=https://api.optimizely.com/v2

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_PROVIDER_PATTERN=false # Set to true to use new provider pattern
ENABLE_AI_GENERATION=false # Set to true to enable AI type generation

# Development Settings
USE_MOCK_PROVIDER=false # Set to true for offline development
MOCK_DATA_PATH=./mock-data
LOG_LEVEL=info # Options: debug, info, warn, error

# Transformation Settings
MIN_CONFIDENCE_SCORE=70 # Minimum confidence for auto-apply
MAX_TRANSFORMATION_DEPTH=10 # Maximum nesting depth
```

### Optimizely API Details
**API Credential Requirements**:
1. Log into Optimizely CMS admin panel
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Create new API key with following scopes:
   - Content Type Read/Write
   - Content Read/Write  
   - Media Read/Write
4. Copy the API key and Project ID
[Source: epic7-prd.md#7.1 Optimizely API Credentials]

### Security Requirements
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Use environment-specific files (.env.local, .env.production)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use read-only keys for development when possible
- Implement key encryption for production environments
[Source: epic7-prd.md#7.3 Security Best Practices]

### Testing Standards
- No unit tests required for this documentation story
- Manual testing: Verify all setup steps work on clean environment
- Validation: Ensure mock mode functions without real credentials
- All documentation must be accurate and tested

### Important Notes
- This is the first story of Epic 7 - focuses entirely on documentation and setup
- No code changes to existing Optimizely integration in this story
- Sets foundation for subsequent provider pattern implementation
- Mock data structure should align with future universal type system
