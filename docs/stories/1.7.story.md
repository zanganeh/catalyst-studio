# Story 1.7: Basic Chat Persistence

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my chat conversations to persist across sessions,
**so that** I don't lose my work on refresh.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chat messages saved to localStorage
2. Automatic save on each message
3. Recovery on page reload
4. Clear storage option in settings
5. Feature flag: `projectPersistence`

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Storage Service Architecture (AC: 1, 2)
- [x] Create `lib/storage/storage-service.ts` with progressive enhancement strategy
  - [x] Implement IndexedDBStorage class (primary - 50MB+)
  - [x] Implement LocalStorage class (fallback - 5-10MB)
  - [x] Implement SessionStorage class (emergency - session only)
  - [x] Implement MemoryStorage class (last resort - no persistence)
- [x] Create storage strategy selector that tries each in order
- [x] Add error handling with fallback to next strategy
- [x] Add storage quota detection and handling
- [x] Write unit tests for each storage strategy

### Task 2: Create Chat Persistence Model (AC: 1)
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for persisted chat data:
  - [x] PersistedChat interface with messages, timestamp, version
  - [x] ChatSnapshot interface for periodic saves
  - [x] StorageMetadata for tracking storage health
- [x] Create data migration strategy for future schema changes
- [x] Add validation using existing Zod setup
- [x] Document storage key patterns: `catalyst:chat:${sessionId}`

### Task 3: Integrate Persistence with Existing Chat (AC: 2, 3)
- [x] Create `hooks/use-chat-persistence.ts` hook
  - [x] Auto-save on message addition (debounced 500ms)
  - [x] Load persisted messages on mount
  - [x] Handle storage errors gracefully
- [x] Wrap existing chat component with persistence layer
  - [x] DO NOT modify core `/app/chat` logic directly
  - [x] Use composition pattern to add persistence
- [x] Add loading state while recovering messages
- [x] Implement optimistic updates with rollback on failure

### Task 4: Add Settings UI for Storage Management (AC: 4)
- [x] Create `components/settings/storage-settings.tsx` component
- [x] Add "Clear Chat History" button with confirmation dialog
- [x] Display current storage usage and quota
- [x] Add export/import functionality for chat history (JSON format)
- [x] Style with existing Catalyst X dark theme
- [x] Integrate with navigation sidebar under Settings section

### Task 5: Implement Feature Flag Protection (AC: 5)
- [x] Add `projectPersistence` flag to feature configuration
- [x] Wrap persistence logic in feature flag checks
- [x] Ensure chat works without persistence when flag is disabled
- [x] Add fallback to non-persistent mode on errors
- [x] Test both enabled and disabled states

### Task 6: Add Performance Monitoring
- [x] Measure save operation time (target: <100ms)
- [x] Add console warnings if save exceeds threshold
- [x] Monitor storage quota usage
- [x] Add metrics for storage strategy selection
- [x] Create performance baseline tests

### Task 7: Write Comprehensive Tests
- [x] Unit tests for StorageService and all strategies
- [x] Integration tests for chat persistence flow
- [x] E2E tests with Playwright:
  - [x] Test message persistence across refresh
  - [x] Test storage clearing functionality
  - [x] Test feature flag toggle behavior
- [x] Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Test storage quota exceeded handling

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#Persistence Layer Architecture]

The persistence layer uses a progressive enhancement storage strategy with multiple fallback options:

```typescript
// Progressive Enhancement Storage
class StorageService {
  private strategies = [
    new IndexedDBStorage(),  // Primary: 50MB+
    new LocalStorage(),      // Fallback: 5-10MB
    new SessionStorage(),    // Emergency: Session only
    new MemoryStorage()      // Last resort: No persistence
  ];
}
```

### Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Critical Integration Rules]
- **CRITICAL**: Never modify `/app/chat` core logic directly
- Use composition and wrapper patterns for adding persistence
- All persistence must be behind the `projectPersistence` feature flag
- Maintain existing chat functionality when persistence is disabled

### Chat Persistence Model
[Source: architecture.md#Chat Persistence Model]
```typescript
interface PersistedChat {
  messages: Message[];
  timestamp: Date;
  version: string;  // For migration support
  metadata: {
    sessionId: string;
    userId?: string;
    projectId?: string;
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD - Protection Requirements]
- Storage errors don't crash chat
- Performance impact < 100ms per save
- Storage quota handling (5MB limit for localStorage)
- Automatic fallback to next storage strategy on failure

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: 1.6.story.md - Completion Notes]
Story 1.6 implemented sophisticated state management with Zustand including:
- Persistence with rollback support
- Multi-level error handling
- Storage quota detection
- This can serve as a reference for implementing chat persistence

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new files should be created at:
- `lib/storage/` - Storage service and strategies
- `hooks/use-chat-persistence.ts` - Persistence hook
- `components/settings/storage-settings.tsx` - Settings UI
- `config/features.ts` - Feature flag configuration

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for persistence flow
- E2E tests with Playwright for full user journey
- Performance tests to ensure <100ms save time
- Test files location: `tests/features/persistence.spec.ts`

### Security Considerations
- No sensitive data should be stored in localStorage
- API keys and tokens must remain in memory only
- Consider data encryption for future iterations
- Add data sanitization before storage

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Chat continues working when persistence disabled
- IV2: Storage errors handled gracefully without crashes  
- IV3: Performance remains under 100ms per save
- IV4: Feature flag toggle works correctly
