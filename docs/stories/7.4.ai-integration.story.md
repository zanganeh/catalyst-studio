# Story 7.4: Create AI System Prompt Integration

## Status
Ready for QA

## Estimation
3-4 days (development time)

## Story
**As an** AI system,  
**I want** structured templates with dynamic knowledge of existing types and components,  
**so that** I can intelligently generate new content types that leverage existing components, follow best practices, and avoid duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dynamic primitive type loader that reads all available primitive types using reflection/introspection
2. Database content type loader that fetches existing content types and properties **for the current website/project only**
3. Dynamic property loader that identifies reusable properties (e.g., ContentArea, components) **within current project scope**
4. Static prompt templates with injection points for dynamic content
5. Generation rules documentation that combines static guidelines with dynamic awareness
6. Validation system that prevents recreation of existing types and ensures proper reuse
7. Type examples catalog that includes both static examples AND dynamically loaded types
8. System prompt enhancement that injects current system state into AI context
9. Integration with existing prompt system (lib/prompts/) for universal type generation
10. CLAUDE.md updated with hybrid generation patterns and commands
11. Platform capability matrix based on real platform analysis
12. Confidence scoring system for generated types
13. Session-aware context that updates with newly generated types in real-time

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Primitive type loader successfully reads all types from lib/providers/universal/types/primitives/
- [ ] Database loader fetches existing content types and properties **for current website context only**
- [ ] Static prompt templates created with dynamic injection points
- [ ] Generation rules document combines static patterns with dynamic type references
- [ ] AI can reference and reuse existing types/components in generation
- [ ] Validation prevents duplicate type creation
- [ ] Type examples include both curated examples and live system types
- [ ] System prompts successfully merge static templates with dynamic context
- [ ] Integration with lib/prompts/ completed for universal type templates
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with hybrid generation commands
- [ ] Platform capability matrix populated from actual system analysis
- [ ] Integration tests prove AI uses both static guidance and dynamic context properly
- [ ] All tests passing (unit and integration)
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by team
- [ ] PR approved by tech lead

## Success Metrics
- AI successfully reuses existing components when applicable
- Zero duplicate type creation when similar types exist
- AI references existing primitive types correctly
- Generated types follow static templates while adapting to current system state
- 70%+ confidence score for generated types
- 10+ static example types provide patterns for common use cases
- AI recognizes and avoids recreating types it just generated in the same session

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Too much context overwhelms AI
  - **Mitigation**: Load only current project's types, not all system types
- **Risk**: Static templates become outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Regular review process, version control for templates
- **Risk**: Conflict between static rules and dynamic state
  - **Mitigation**: Clear precedence rules, validation layer to catch conflicts

    ```markdown
    # Universal Type Generation Rules
    
    ## Rule 1: Check for Existing Types First
    Before creating any new type, check if {{existingContentTypes}} already contains it.
    Example: If BlogPost exists, don't create ArticlePage - suggest using BlogPost
    
    ## Rule 2: Use Only Available Primitive Types
    All fields MUST use types from {{availableTypes}}:
    - For short text (titles, names) → Use 'Text'
    - For long content → Use 'LongText'
    - For media → Use 'Media'
    
    ## Rule 3: Reuse Components
    If {{reusableComponents}} includes ContentArea, use it for complex content
    
    ## Validation Requirements:
    - Type name must be unique (not in {{existingContentTypes}})
    - All field types must exist in {{availableTypes}}
    - Follow naming: PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields
    ```

- [x] Create Static Prompt Templates with Dynamic Injection
  - [x] Create `prompts/universal-types/templates/content-type-generation.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Generate Universal Content Type
    
    ## Current Project Context:
    Project: {{projectContext}}
    
    ## Available Building Blocks:
    Primitive Types: {{availableTypes}}
    Existing Types in Project: {{existingContentTypes}}
    Reusable Components: {{reusableComponents}}
    
    ## Your Task:
    Create a content type that:
    1. Doesn't duplicate existing types above
    2. Uses only primitive types listed above
    3. Reuses components where applicable
    
    ## Output Format:
    {
      "name": "TypeName",
      "category": "page|component",
      "fields": [
        {"name": "fieldName", "type": "Text", "required": true}
      ]
    }
    ```
  
  - [x] Create `prompts/universal-types/templates/duplication-check.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Check for Duplicate Types
    
    ## Requested Type: [User's Request]
    
    ## Existing Types in Project:
    {{existingContentTypes}}
    
    ## Analysis:
    1. Does exact type name exist? → Check {{existingContentTypes}}
    2. Is there 80%+ field overlap with existing type?
    3. Can existing type be extended instead?
    
    ## Response:
    IF duplicate found: "Use existing [TypeName] instead"
    IF no duplicate: "Safe to create new type"

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context
**Parent Epic**: Epic 7 - Universal Type System Implementation
- This story is part of the larger Universal Type System initiative
- Builds upon Story 7.3 (Three-Layer Type System) which established the primitive types foundation
- Goal: Enable AI to intelligently generate content types using both static templates and dynamic system awareness
- Part of the brownfield project approach to incrementally improve the existing Catalyst Studio system

### GitFlow Workflow
**Branch Name**: feature/epic7-ai-integration  
**Base Branch**: main  
**PR Target**: main  

**Git Commands**:
1. Setup: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. Create: `git checkout -b feature/epic7-ai-integration`
3. Commit: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, test:)
4. Push: `git push -u origin feature/epic7-ai-integration`
5. PR: Create PR to main branch with title "Epic 7 Story 7.4: Hybrid AI System Prompt Integration"

**Commit Message Guidelines**:
- feat: New feature implementation
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation changes
- test: Test additions or changes
- chore: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- refactor: Code refactoring without feature changes

### Testing Standards
**Test Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: Alongside implementation files as `*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` directory
- E2E tests: `__tests__/e2e/` directory
- Test fixtures: `__tests__/fixtures/` directory

**Testing Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for loaders and validators
- All dynamic loaders must have unit tests
- Template population logic must be tested with various contexts
- Validation system requires comprehensive test coverage
- Mock database calls for unit tests
- Use real type system files for integration tests

**Test Execution Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Testing Patterns**:
- Use describe/it blocks for test organization
- Mock external dependencies (database, file system)
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure async operations are properly tested

### Hybrid Architecture Key Points
- **Static Templates**: Provide structure, rules, and guidance for AI
- **Dynamic Loaders**: Provide current state awareness and prevent duplication
- **Integration Layer**: Merges both approaches seamlessly
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages lib/prompts/ and lib/providers/universal/
- **Project Isolation**: Each website/project has its own isolated context - no cross-contamination
- **Session Awareness**: Newly generated types are immediately available in the same session

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Extends current prompt system rather than replacing it
- Uses universal type system as source of truth
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows

### Directory Structure Clarification
- **Code Files** (`lib/prompts/`): All TypeScript implementation files
  - `lib/prompts/loaders/` - Dynamic loading implementations
  - `lib/prompts/context/` - Context builders and managers
- **Configuration Files** (`prompts/universal-types/`): Templates and rules
  - `prompts/universal-types/templates/` - Static prompt templates
  - `prompts/universal-types/rules/` - Generation rules documentation
  - `prompts/universal-types/examples/` - Example type definitions
  - `prompts/universal-types/platform/` - Platform capability matrices
- **Rationale**: Separation of code (lib/) from configuration (prompts/) for clarity

### Implementation Notes
- Dynamic loading happens on each request (no caching in MVP)
- Load all types for current project (no lazy loading needed yet)
- Simple context building without optimization

### How Templates Work - Concrete Example

**Step 1: User Request**
```
"I need a content type for news articles"
```

**Step 2: System Loads Dynamic Data** (Phase 2 loaders)
```typescript
const dynamicContext = {
  availableTypes: ["Text", "LongText", "Number", "Boolean", "Date", "Media"],
  existingContentTypes: [
    "BlogPost (title: Text, content: LongText, author: Text, publishDate: Date)",
    "ProductPage (name: Text, description: LongText, price: Number)"
  ],
  reusableComponents: ["ContentArea", "CTAComponent"],
  projectContext: "Website: TechNews, ID: proj_123"
};
```

**Step 3: Template Gets Populated** (Phase 3 templates)
The template `content-type-generation.md` becomes:
```markdown
## Available Building Blocks:
Primitive Types: Text, LongText, Number, Boolean, Date, Media
Existing Types in Project: BlogPost, ProductPage
Reusable Components: ContentArea, CTAComponent
```

**Step 4: AI Sees Full Context and Responds**
```json
{
  "decision": "USE_EXISTING",
  "reason": "BlogPost type already exists with all needed fields for news articles",
  "suggestion": "Use existing BlogPost type instead of creating duplicate"
}
```

This prevents duplication and ensures reuse!

### Previous Story Context (Story 7.3)
**Three-Layer Type System Implemented**:
- Primitive types defined in lib/providers/universal/types/primitives/
- Common patterns implemented
- Platform extensions structure created
- This story builds on that by making AI aware of these types

### Database Schema Context
**Content Types Storage** (from existing Optimizely implementation):
- **Primary Tables/Collections**:
  - `websites` - Website configurations and metadata
  - `content_types` - Content type definitions per website
  - `content_items` - Actual content instances
  - `content_versions` - Version history tracking
- **Key Fields for Type Loading**:
  - `content_types.website_id` - For project isolation
  - `content_types.definition` - JSON schema of type structure
  - `content_types.properties` - Field definitions and validation rules
  - `content_types.category` - 'page' or 'component' classification
- **Query Pattern**: Filter by `website_id` from current session context

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each loader
- Integration tests for hybrid system
- End-to-end AI generation tests
- Focus on correctness, not performance

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `__tests__/prompts/` directory for all prompt-related tests
- **Test Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Test Patterns**:
  - Unit tests: `*.test.ts` files alongside implementation
  - Integration tests: `__tests__/integration/` directory
  - E2E tests: `__tests__/e2e/` directory
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for loaders and validators
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock database calls, use real type system files
- **Test Data**: Use fixtures from `__tests__/fixtures/` for consistent testing

## Dependencies
- Story 7.3: Three-Layer Type System (Must be complete)
- Database schema must be stable
- Existing prompt system (lib/prompts/) must be functional
- Universal type system (lib/providers/universal/) must be complete

#### Areas for Improvement 🔧

##### 1. **Error Handling & Resilience** (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Basic try-catch blocks without proper error recovery
```typescript
// Current: primitive-type-loader.ts:52-54
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error loading primitive types:', error);
  return [];
}
```
**Recommendation**: Implement proper error handling with recovery strategies:
```typescript
catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to load primitive types', { error, path: this.primitiveTypesPath });
  // Attempt fallback to cached types
  const cached = await this.loadCachedTypes();
  if (cached.length > 0) {
    logger.warn('Using cached primitive types');
    return cached;
  }
  throw new TypeLoadingError('Unable to load primitive types', error);
}
```

##### 2. **Performance Optimization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Dynamic imports in loops without parallelization
```typescript
// Current: primitive-type-loader.ts:47-49
for (const typeDir of typeDirs) {
  await this.loadTypeFromDirectory(typeDir);
}
```
**Recommendation**: Use Promise.all for parallel loading:
```typescript
const loadPromises = typeDirs.map(typeDir => this.loadTypeFromDirectory(typeDir));
await Promise.all(loadPromises);
```

##### 3. **Type Safety Improvements** (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Using `any` types in critical paths
```typescript
// Current: database-type-loader.ts:75
private transformContentType(ct: any): LoadedContentType
```
**Recommendation**: Define proper types:
```typescript
interface DatabaseContentType {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  websiteId: string;
  fields: ContentTypeFields;
  // ... other properties
}
private transformContentType(ct: DatabaseContentType): LoadedContentType
```

##### 4. **Security Considerations** (Priority: HIGH)
**Issue**: Dynamic imports without path validation
```typescript
// Current: primitive-type-loader.ts:92
const typeModule = await import(typePath);
```
**Recommendation**: Add path validation:
```typescript
// Validate path is within expected directory
if (!typePath.startsWith(this.primitiveTypesPath)) {
  throw new SecurityError('Invalid type path detected');
}
// Sanitize and validate before import
const sanitizedPath = path.normalize(typePath);
const typeModule = await import(sanitizedPath);
```

##### 5. **Test Coverage Gaps** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Missing Test Scenarios**:
- Edge cases for malformed type definitions
- Concurrent type generation scenarios
- Recovery from partial failures
- Performance under load (100+ types)
- Session overflow scenarios

**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive test cases:
```typescript
describe('Edge Cases', () => {
  it('should handle circular type dependencies gracefully');
  it('should recover from database connection failures');
  it('should handle concurrent type generations');
  it('should perform within 500ms for 100+ types');
});
```

##### 6. **Memory Management** (Priority: LOW)
**Issue**: Maps without size limits
```typescript
// Current: No limit on loadedTypes Map size
private loadedTypes: Map<string, LoadedPrimitiveType> = new Map();
```
**Recommendation**: Implement LRU cache with size limits:
```typescript
private loadedTypes: LRUCache<string, LoadedPrimitiveType> = new LRUCache({
  max: 1000,
  ttl: 1000 * 60 * 60 // 1 hour
});
```

### Refactoring Suggestions 🔄

1. **Extract Constants**:
   ```typescript
   // Create constants file
   export const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
     AUTOMATIC: 90,
     REVIEW: 70,
     MANUAL: 50,
     REJECTED: 0
   } as const;
   ```

2. **Implement Factory Pattern** for loader creation:
   ```typescript
   class LoaderFactory {
     static createLoader(type: 'primitive' | 'database' | 'property'): BaseLoader {
       // Return appropriate loader instance
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add Monitoring Hooks**:
   ```typescript
   interface MetricsCollector {
     recordTypeGeneration(type: string, confidence: number): void;
     recordDuplicatePrevented(existingType: string): void;
     recordLoadTime(component: string, duration: number): void;
   }
   ```

### Security Review 🔒
- ✅ Project isolation through websiteId filtering
- ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities (using Prisma ORM)
- ⚠️ Dynamic imports need path validation
- ⚠️ Add input sanitization for user-provided type names
- ⚠️ Consider rate limiting for type generation

### Performance Considerations ⚡
- Current implementation is synchronous in critical paths
- No caching mechanism (acknowledged as MVP limitation)
- Recommendation: Implement progressive loading for large type sets
- Consider adding telemetry for performance monitoring
