# Epic 5: AI-Powered Content Management Tool Integration - Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Scope Assessment

This is a **SIGNIFICANT enhancement** to the existing Catalyst Studio CMS that warrants a full PRD process. The enhancement involves:
- Transforming the existing AI chat interface from passive advisor to active executor
- Implementing 10 new AI tools with database manipulation capabilities
- Adding new context management and business rule systems
- Integrating with existing Prisma ORM and services
- 4-week implementation timeline with multiple coordinated stories

This is not a simple feature addition but a fundamental capability transformation requiring architectural planning and multiple coordinated stories.

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis of Catalyst Studio project
- Epic-5 requirements document available at: `docs/epic-5-requirements-document.md`
- Original AI tools requirements with POC validation at: `docs/ai-tools-requirements-document.md`

#### Current Project State
Catalyst Studio is an existing Next.js 14-based CMS with:
- **Current AI capability**: Chat interface in `lib/services/ai-prompt-processor.ts` that provides content management advice
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for content management
- **Architecture**: Server components, API routes, existing website/content type/content item models
- **Deployment**: Vercel infrastructure
- **Authentication**: No authentication/authorization in MVP phase

The project currently has a functional AI assistant that can analyze prompts and provide suggestions, but cannot execute any database operations directly.

### Available Documentation Analysis

#### Available Documentation
- [✓] Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js 14, Prisma, PostgreSQL identified)
- [✓] Source Tree/Architecture (Clear `/app`, `/lib`, `/tests` structure)
- [✓] API Documentation (Existing API routes in `/app/api/`)
- [✓] External API Documentation (POC validates OpenRouter integration)
- [✓] Technical Debt Documentation (POC addresses main limitation)
- [Partial] Coding Standards (TypeScript, existing patterns visible)
- [ ] UX/UI Guidelines (Will maintain existing chat interface)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- [✓] New Feature Addition - AI tool execution capability
- [✓] Major Feature Modification - Transform existing AI chat behavior
- [✓] Integration with New Systems - OpenRouter API, Vercel AI SDK

#### Enhancement Description
Transform the existing AI chat interface to execute content management operations directly in the database through structured tool calling, enabling users to manage content through natural language commands with automatic business rule application.

#### Impact Assessment
- [✓] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes) - AI prompt processor needs enhancement
- [✓] Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes) - New tool system, context management

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable AI to execute database operations directly, not just advise
- Reduce content setup time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes
- Achieve 95% tool execution success rate
- Maintain full compatibility with existing content management UI
- Provide complete audit trail and rollback capabilities

#### Background Context
The existing AI assistant in Catalyst Studio operates as a read-only advisor, creating friction when users must manually implement every suggestion. With a validated POC showing 100% test success rate using structured tool calling patterns from industry leaders (Cursor, Copilot), we can transform this into an active content management system. This enhancement directly addresses user frustration with the implementation gap and positions Catalyst Studio competitively as AI-powered CMS solutions become standard.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The enhancement SHALL integrate AI tool execution capability into the existing chat interface without breaking current advisory functionality.

**FR2:** The system SHALL implement 10 MVP tools as TypeScript functions using Vercel AI SDK, organized into three categories (Website Management: 3, Content Type Management: 4, Content Item Management: 3).

**FR3:** Each tool SHALL execute database operations through the existing Prisma ORM with full parameter validation using Zod schemas.

**FR4:** The context provider SHALL dynamically load current website metadata, content structures, and business requirements before each AI interaction.

**FR5:** The AI SHALL apply category-specific business rules automatically based on website type (blog, e-commerce, portfolio) without user specification.

**FR6:** All tool executions SHALL be wrapped in database transactions ensuring atomic operations (complete success or full rollback).

**FR7:** The system SHALL maintain streaming response UI showing real-time progress of AI operations.

**FR8:** Every AI action SHALL be logged for audit purposes with timestamp and operation details.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Tool execution SHALL complete within 2 seconds for standard operations to maintain responsive user experience.

**NFR2:** Context loading SHALL not exceed 500ms to prevent noticeable delays in AI responses.

**NFR3:** The system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages when operations fail.

**NFR4:** The enhancement SHALL maintain the existing chat interface design and interaction patterns.

**NFR5:** Failed operations SHALL never corrupt existing data or leave the database in an inconsistent state.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility** - All current API endpoints must continue functioning without modification. New AI tool endpoints will be added under `/app/api/ai-tools/`.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility** - No modifications to existing Prisma schema allowed. New tool operations must work with current models (Website, ContentType, ContentItem).

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency** - AI tool responses must maintain the same chat interface styling, message formatting, and interaction patterns users are familiar with.

**CR4: Open Access for MVP** - AI tools will operate without authentication/authorization in the MVP phase, allowing all users full access to tool execution capabilities.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React Server Components, Tailwind CSS  
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment platform  
**External Dependencies**: OpenRouter API (for AI models), Vercel AI SDK

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: All AI tools will execute database operations through the existing Prisma client instance. Tools will import and use existing services (WebsiteService, ContentTypeService, ContentItemService) to maintain consistency with current data access patterns.

**API Integration Strategy**: New AI tool endpoints will be created under `/app/api/ai-tools/` following the existing API route patterns. The enhanced chat endpoint will call these tool APIs internally while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: The existing chat interface will be enhanced with streaming response support using React Server Components. Tool execution results will be displayed using the current message component structure with added progress indicators.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: New integration tests will be added alongside existing test suites in `/tests/` and `/e2e/`. The POC test patterns will be adapted to test actual database operations instead of file operations.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing project structure - tools in `/app/api/ai-tools/`, shared logic in `/lib/services/`, types in `/lib/types/`. Each tool category gets its own subdirectory.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing conventions - kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables. Tool names will use kebab-case (e.g., `create-content-type`).

**Coding Standards**: TypeScript strict mode, existing ESLint configuration, async/await pattern for database operations, consistent error handling with try-catch blocks.

**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc comments for all tool functions, README in `/app/api/ai-tools/` explaining tool architecture, inline comments for complex business logic.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to existing Next.js build process. Environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` will be added to `.env.local` for AI model access.

**Deployment Strategy**: Standard Vercel deployment with environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard. Feature can be toggled via environment variable if needed.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize existing logging infrastructure. Add specific log entries for tool execution start/end, errors, and rollbacks.

**Configuration Management**: API keys and model selection in environment variables. Tool configurations (timeouts, limits) in a central config file.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- AI model API availability - Mitigate with retry logic and graceful degradation
- Database transaction deadlocks - Use appropriate isolation levels and timeout settings
- Token limits for large contexts - Implement context pruning strategies

**Integration Risks**: 
- Conflicts with existing chat functionality - Maintain separate code paths for advisory vs execution modes
- Service layer modifications affecting other features - Use existing service methods without modification where possible

**Deployment Risks**: 
- API key exposure - Ensure keys only in environment variables, never in code
- Unexpected database load - Implement operation limits and monitoring

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Comprehensive integration testing before production
- Feature flag for gradual rollout
- Detailed logging for debugging production issues
- Rollback plan with version tags

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic for the AI-powered content management enhancement. This is the right approach because:
- All 10 tools work together to deliver the complete capability
- Stories build incrementally on shared infrastructure (context provider, tool executor)
- Breaking into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries
- The enhancement represents one cohesive feature from the user's perspective
