## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-11
- **Author**: John (Product Manager)
- **Epic**: Epic 2 - Complete Feature Flag Infrastructure Removal and Test Cleanup

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- **IDE-based fresh analysis** - Working with the Catalyst Studio project loaded in the current directory

#### Current Project State
Based on my analysis of the Catalyst Studio project, this is a comprehensive creative studio application built with Next.js and TypeScript that provides:

1. **Brand Creation & Management**: Full brand identity creation with logos, color palettes, typography
2. **Visual Identity System**: Comprehensive visual design tools and guidelines
3. **Design System Management**: Component libraries, patterns, and design tokens
4. **Review & Approval Workflows**: Design review processes with feedback and iteration
5. **Case Study Generation**: Professional portfolio case study creation

The application recently completed Epic 1 with multiple stories implementing various features including source code view capabilities.

### 1.2 Documentation Analysis

#### Available Documentation
✓ Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, SQLite)  
✓ Source Tree/Architecture (app router structure, lib services)  
✓ API Documentation (server actions pattern)  
✓ External API Documentation (OpenAI integrations for design generation)  
✓ Technical Debt Documentation (feature flags system currently in use)  
□ UX/UI Guidelines  
□ Coding Standards (implicit through existing patterns)

### 1.3 Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
✓ **Bug Fix and Stability Improvements** - Cleanup and optimization

#### Enhancement Description
Epic 2 focuses on cleaning up the application infrastructure by removing all feature flags and their associated infrastructure now that all features are live. This includes updating the test suite, particularly end-to-end tests, to test everything in production mode.

#### Impact Assessment
✓ **Moderate Impact** - This cleanup will touch multiple files across the codebase but won't change core functionality

### 1.4 Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Remove all feature flag infrastructure and related code
- Simplify the codebase by eliminating conditional feature checks
- Update all tests to run against live features without flag dependencies
- Improve maintainability by reducing complexity

#### Background Context
The Catalyst Studio application has successfully launched all features that were previously behind feature flags. These flags were essential during development to control feature rollout and testing, but now that everything is live and stable, they add unnecessary complexity to the codebase. Removing them will simplify maintenance, reduce potential bugs from flag misconfigurations, and streamline the testing process.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system shall remove all feature flag checking logic from the application codebase while maintaining identical functionality for all previously flagged features
- **FR2**: The system shall delete the feature flag configuration infrastructure including any configuration files, database tables, or environment variables used for feature flags
- **FR3**: The system shall update all conditional rendering logic to unconditionally render previously feature-flagged components
- **FR4**: The system shall remove all feature flag related imports, utilities, and helper functions from the codebase
- **FR5**: The system shall update all unit tests to remove feature flag mocking and test all features as permanently enabled
- **FR6**: The system shall update all end-to-end tests to test features directly without feature flag manipulation
- **FR7**: The system shall remove any feature flag management UI components if they exist
- **FR8**: The system shall update any API endpoints that previously accepted feature flag parameters

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: Code removal must maintain existing performance characteristics with no degradation in page load times or runtime performance
- **NFR2**: The cleanup process must preserve all git history for code archaeology purposes
- **NFR3**: All tests must maintain or improve their current execution time after feature flag removal
- **NFR4**: The codebase must maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing user data and sessions
- **NFR5**: Code changes must follow existing TypeScript strict mode and linting standards
- **NFR6**: The cleanup must not introduce any new npm dependencies

### 2.3 Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1**: All existing API contracts must remain unchanged - no breaking changes to public or internal APIs
- **CR2**: Database schema must remain compatible - no destructive migrations, only removal of unused flag-related columns/tables if they exist
- **CR3**: UI/UX must remain identical - users should see no visual or behavioral changes after feature flag removal
- **CR4**: All existing integrations with external services (OpenAI, etc.) must continue to function without modification

## 3. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS  
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS  
**Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM  
**Infrastructure**: Node.js, npm/pnpm package management  
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI API, Radix UI components, Lucide icons, TanStack Query

### 3.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- Identify and remove feature flag related columns from Prisma schema
- Generate migration to clean up database structure
- Ensure no orphaned data remains after flag removal

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Remove feature flag parameters from all server actions
- Simplify conditional logic in API route handlers
- Maintain existing API response structures for compatibility

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Remove feature flag hooks and context providers
- Convert conditional renders to permanent implementations
- Clean up component props that passed flag states

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Remove feature flag test utilities and mocks
- Update test setup files to remove flag initialization
- Ensure all test scenarios now test the "enabled" state

### 3.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
- Remove `/lib/feature-flags` directory and all related utilities
- Clean up `/hooks` directory of feature flag related hooks
- Update `/app` routes to remove flag-based routing logic

**Naming Conventions**:
- Remove all variables/functions with "flag", "feature", or "toggle" prefixes
- Maintain existing camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components

**Coding Standards**:
- Follow existing TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Maintain current ESLint and Prettier settings
- Keep existing pattern of server actions in dedicated files

**Documentation Standards**:
- Update inline comments to remove feature flag references
- Clean up README if it contains feature flag documentation
- Document the removal in a migration guide for team reference

### 3.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- Remove any build-time feature flag injection
- Clean up environment variable configuration
- Update build scripts if they reference feature flags

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Deploy as a single release after thorough testing
- No database downtime required (non-destructive changes)
- Consider feature branch deployment for final validation

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Remove feature flag state from log entries
- Update any metrics that track feature flag usage
- Ensure error tracking still functions without flag context

**Configuration Management**:
- Remove feature flag environment variables from .env files
- Update deployment configurations (Vercel, etc.)
- Clean up any feature flag configuration files

### 3.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Risk: Removing too much code and breaking hidden dependencies
- Risk: Missing feature flag references in less obvious places
- Risk: Test suite becomes brittle after flag removal

**Integration Risks**:
- Risk: External services might expect feature flag headers/parameters
- Risk: Cached responses might include feature flag data
- Risk: Database migrations could affect production data

**Deployment Risks**:
- Risk: Incomplete removal causing runtime errors
- Risk: Performance regression from removed optimizations
- Risk: Missing edge cases in testing

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive code search using multiple patterns (grep, AST analysis)
- Staged removal: first deprecate, then remove in next iteration
- Extensive testing including manual QA pass
- Keep detailed rollback plan with git commits clearly marked
- Monitor error rates closely post-deployment

## 4. Epic and Story Structure

### 4.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic for feature flag removal

This cleanup work represents a single cohesive objective - removing feature flag infrastructure. Breaking it into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and potential integration issues. The work is interdependent: removing flags from code requires updating tests, and both must happen in coordination. A single epic ensures atomic completion and easier rollback if needed.

## 5. Epic 2: Complete Feature Flag Infrastructure Removal and Test Cleanup

**Epic Goal**: Remove all feature flag infrastructure from Catalyst Studio now that Epic 1 is complete and all features are live, simplifying the codebase and ensuring all tests run against production functionality.

**Integration Requirements**: All changes must preserve the functionality delivered in Epic 1, maintain backward compatibility, and ensure zero downtime during deployment. Each story must verify that existing features continue to work correctly.

**GitFlow Strategy**: Each story will be developed in its own feature branch, following the pattern `feature/story-2.x-description`. All branches will be created from `main` and merged back via pull request after review.

### Story 2.1: Audit and Document Feature Flag Usage

# Branch creation
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/story-2.1-audit-feature-flags

# During development
git add .
git commit -m "feat(audit): Document all feature flag usage locations"
git commit -m "feat(audit): Create dependency map for feature flags"
git commit -m "feat(audit): Identify test files using feature flags"

# Completion
git push origin feature/story-2.1-audit-feature-flags
