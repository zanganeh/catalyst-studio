#### Impact Assessment
- ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- The current simple chat implementation will be significantly enhanced with structured prompt systems, workflow management, and integration with the visual UI components from the mockup

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Transform the approved HTML mockup into a production React/Next.js application maintaining the exact UI/UX customers have validated
- Enhance the simple AI chat to support structured website generation workflows with content modeling
- Implement the core content type builder and visual preview capabilities demonstrated in the mockup
- Establish the foundation for CMS integration starting with mock deployments
- Create a working MVP that demonstrates the complete user journey from natural language to website prototype

#### Background Context
The project has reached a critical milestone with customer validation of the UI/UX through the HTML mockup. The existing AI chat implementation using OpenRouter and Vercel AI SDK provides a working foundation for conversational interactions. Now we need to bridge these elements - transforming the static mockup into a dynamic application while enhancing the AI capabilities to deliver on the core value proposition of rapid website prototyping and CMS deployment.

This enhancement is essential to move from proof-of-concept to a functional MVP that can be demonstrated to potential users and early adopters. The focus is on delivering the core experience that validates the product-market fit while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
